## [Unreleased]

## [1.16.0] — 2026-08-20

### Added

- **Mobile-friendly reorder fallback for the Categories/Albums drag-and-drop
  (LG-047).** The Categories tree and the Albums hierarchy view's
  drag-to-reorder both use native HTML5 drag-and-drop, which never fires
  from touch input, making reordering unusable on a phone despite the
  drag handle being visible there. Both pages now show Up/Down buttons
  instead of the drag handle on mobile — they swap a row with its
  immediate sibling within the same group (same parent category / same
  category section) using the same reorder endpoints drag-and-drop already
  posts to, with the first/last item in a group getting a disabled button
  at that end. Reparenting (dragging a category "into" another) remains
  desktop/drag-only.

- **New "feature" plugin architecture with a minimal hook system (LG-045),
  and a Visitor Stats plugin built on it.** Previously the only plugin type
  was the on-demand "importer" (Coppermine, etc.), discovered by
  `admin/migrate.php` and run manually. `HookService` (actions + filters)
  and `PluginService` (discovery, enable/disable, and per-request loading of
  enabled plugins) let a new plugin type — "feature" plugins — extend core
  behaviour by registering hooks in its own `bootstrap.php`, with zero
  patches to core files needed for a plugin to add itself. A new **Admin →
  Plugins** page lists every discovered feature plugin with an Enable/Disable
  toggle; every feature plugin ships disabled by default (opt-in).
  Three extension points exist so far: `lumora_pageview` (fires on every
  public pageview — home, category, album, image), `admin_nav_sections`
  (a plugin can add its own sidebar nav item), and
  `admin_dashboard_widgets_html` (a plugin can add its own Dashboard widget).
  The first plugin built on this — **Visitor Stats** (`plugins/lumora-visitor-stats/`)
  — adds a Jetpack-style traffic overview: a daily pageview trend chart
  (7/30/90-day range), Today/Week/Month/All-Time totals, top images, top
  albums, top referrers, and the existing Who-Is-Online numbers, all on its
  own admin page, plus a compact "Last 7 Days" widget on the Dashboard when
  enabled. It logs pageviews to its own database table (created only when
  the plugin is enabled, never touching core's schema), filters out common
  bot/crawler traffic, and stores only a SHA-256 hash of the visitor's IP
  (never the raw address) and the referring host (never a full URL or query
  string) — pruned automatically after 90 days.

- **Mobile/responsive styling for the admin panel (LG-046).** The admin
  chrome previously had only a bare-minimum mobile treatment (a horizontally
  scrolling sidebar nav). `admin/admin.css` now truncates the topbar brand
  instead of overflowing at narrow widths, gives the mobile nav links and
  the collapsible-section chevrons full 44px touch targets, wraps the
  Updates page's source tabs, collapses the Appearance page's theme card
  grid to one column, and tightens card/stat-card padding and modal margins
  on phones. Most page content (Bootstrap grid columns, `.table-responsive`
  tables, flex-wrap toolbars) was already responsive; this fills in the
  admin-specific components that weren't. Also fixed a pre-existing bug
  where `.lum-admin-layout` never switched to a column flex direction on
  mobile, so the sidebar and main content stayed side-by-side instead of
  stacking — the sidebar's default `align-items: stretch` pulled it to the
  full content height and squeezed main content into a sliver beside it.
  Live-device testing also surfaced that several list tables (Categories,
  Images, Albums, Users, Groups) were too column-heavy to fit a phone
  screen even inside their `.table-responsive` wrapper. Non-essential
  columns (Pos, ID, Dimensions, Size, Views, Added, Category, Folder,
  Email, Last Login, Identifier) now hide below the `md`/`lg` breakpoints
  via Bootstrap's `d-none d-md-table-cell`/`d-none d-lg-table-cell`
  utilities, leaving each table's primary identifying and action columns
  visible without a horizontal scroll on mobile. Hiding columns wasn't
  enough for the two most icon/badge-heavy tables — Images (checkbox,
  thumbnail, title, status badge, 3 action buttons) and Albums (title,
  image count, status badge, 4-5 action buttons) still overflowed a phone
  width even after trimming — so those two now use a new
  `.lum-adm-table-stack` treatment: each row renders as a bordered card
  with its cells stacked vertically (small caption + value) instead of a
  horizontally-scrolling table row. The first version of this still
  overflowed on real data: giving every `<td>` `display: flex` made a
  cell's inner `<div>`s lay out as flex items on one line instead of
  stacking, so an unbroken long filename (real thumbnail filenames run
  30-40+ characters) forced the row wide instead of wrapping. Fixed by
  only applying `display: flex` to label:value cells (`[data-label]`) and
  adding `overflow-wrap: anywhere` as the default for all stacked cells.
  Also clamped a feature plugin's description on the Plugins page
  (`admin/plugins.php`) to 3 lines on mobile — a `plugin.json` description
  can run several sentences, which dwarfed the card's Manage/Disable
  controls on a phone screen. The Users table (`admin/users.php`) had the
  same action-row overflow as Images/Albums (up to 4 buttons — Edit,
  Albums, Enable/Disable, Delete — plus Role and Status badges) even after
  hiding its ID/Email/Last Login columns, so it now uses the same
  `.lum-adm-table-stack` card layout on mobile. The Groups table
  (`admin/groups.php`) also turned out to need it despite having only one
  action button — real group names plus Type/Permissions/Users columns
  still didn't fit — so it's now on the same treatment too. Given two
  guesses in a row turned out wrong, Categories (`admin/categories.php`)
  was converted proactively rather than waiting for another report — all
  five admin list tables now use `.lum-adm-table-stack` on mobile.

## [1.15.1] — 2026-08-10

### Added

- **New Album's Folder Path field now shows a notice when the automatic
  on-disk folder search (LG-040) finds no unclaimed folders (LG-044).**
  Previously, once the "Searching for folders on disk…" spinner
  disappeared, a scan that genuinely found zero unclaimed folders left the
  field area silent — no different from a scan that hadn't run at all,
  with no way to tell the two apart. A small "No unclaimed folders found
  on disk" notice now appears in that case. A failed or malformed scan
  (network error, non-JSON response) still stays completely silent as
  before — the field falling back to plain free-text input without any
  error message — since only a genuinely successful, empty-result scan
  warrants telling the admin so.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-08-10

### Added

- **New Admin → Appearance page with a visual theme card grid, replacing
  the plain theme dropdown on Configuration (LG-043).** Theme selection
  and the display-related settings (`theme`, `default_color_mode`,
  `category_layout`, `show_powered_by`) previously lived inside
  Configuration's "Appearance" card; they now have their own page,
  `admin/appearance.php`, with its own "Appearance" item under Settings
  in the sidebar. Every installed theme (from `lumora_list_themes()`) is
  shown as a card: a screenshot on top (a file named `preview.*`,
  `thumbnail.*`, or `screenshot.*` in the theme's folder, in that
  priority order, with numbered variants like `screenshot-2.jpg`
  supported and a neutral placeholder shown when none exist), the theme's
  name and author below with an **Active** badge on the current theme,
  and **Activate**/**Preview**/**Details** actions underneath the
  thumbnail. **Details** opens a modal with the theme's full screenshot
  gallery, author, design URI, and folder name. Two new capabilities go
  beyond what Configuration's old theme table offered: **install a theme
  from an uploaded `.zip`** (validated — real ZIP structure, entry-count
  and uncompressed-size caps, unsafe-path/path-traversal rejection, a
  `template.html` present in the archive, a single wrapping top-level
  folder such as a GitHub export auto-flattened, and the destination
  folder name derived from the theme's own declared `Theme Name` header
  where present), and **update an already-installed theme in place** by
  re-uploading a `.zip` for its existing folder name — a deliberate
  divergence from the plain install path, which still hard-rejects a
  name collision — gated behind an explicit "this will overwrite the
  currently-installed files" confirmation, with the upload staged to a
  temp folder and only swapped over the live theme via `rename()` after
  every validation check passes, so a bad upload can never leave a
  half-extracted theme live. Non-active, non-bundled themes also get a
  **Delete** action; the two bundled themes (`default`, `classic-fansite`)
  and whichever theme is currently active can never be deleted. All of
  this new theme-management logic lives in a new
  `include/services/ThemeService.php` service class, following the
  project's established static-service pattern. The unsafe-ZIP-entry-name
  check this reuses (path traversal, absolute paths, backslashes, null
  bytes) is now a single shared `lumora_is_unsafe_zip_entry_name()`
  helper in `include/functions.php`, called by both `ThemeService` and
  `UpdaterService` — previously `UpdaterService` had its own private copy
  of this exact check.

- **Admin → Updates now supports installing from an uploaded ZIP, in
  addition to the existing GitHub-based updater (LG-042).** Previously
  the only way to install a Lumora Gallery release was the "Update Now"
  button against a GitHub-fetched archive — with no option for hosts
  that can't make outbound HTTPS requests to GitHub, and no way to
  install a build that isn't published as a tagged GitHub release. A new
  **📦 Install from Uploaded ZIP** panel lets an administrator upload a
  release ZIP directly; the package is validated (ZIP structure,
  path-traversal/unsafe-entry rejection, entry-count and
  uncompressed-size caps, PHP-version and disk-space checks against the
  package's own `LUMORA_MIN_PHP`/`version.php`) and, once accepted, feeds
  its detected version into the exact same 10-stage
  `preflight → download → verify → backup → maintenance → extract →
  validate → replace → migrate → cleanup` pipeline, automatic update
  backup, and rollback-on-failure behavior the GitHub flow already uses
  — `UpdaterService::acquireLockFromUpload()` stages the uploaded archive
  at the same path a downloaded release would occupy, so every stage
  from Download onward (which skips re-fetching a present archive) runs
  unmodified — `stageDownload()`'s resume check now runs before its
  download-URL requirement rather than after, since an uploaded package
  deliberately has no download URL at all. A new
  `admin/ajax_update_upload.php` endpoint
  (`site_configuration`-gated, CSRF-protected) handles the upload; the
  progress panel, stage list, and stuck-session recovery UI are now
  shared between both update sources rather than only appearing when a
  GitHub release happens to be available.

- **New Album's Folder Path field now shows a "Searching for folders on
  disk…" indicator while the on-disk folder scan (LG-040) is running.**
  On galleries with a large `albums/` tree the scan can take a few
  seconds, and with no feedback the field looked inert during that time.
  A spinner + text placeholder now appears next to the field as soon as
  the page loads and disappears once the scan finishes (success, empty
  result, or failure) — same fetch, same fallback-to-plain-input
  behavior on error, just visible progress in between.

### Changed

- **Opt-in Anonymous Install Ping endpoint moved to its own subdirectory.**
  `InstallPingService::ENDPOINT` now sends to
  `https://coding.unloved-heart.net/lumoragallery/install-tracking-server/ping.php`
  (was `.../lumoragallery/ping.php`) — the receiving service now lives at
  its own `install-tracking-server/` path on that host instead of sitting
  directly at the `lumoragallery` docroot. Purely a server-side deployment
  change; the ping itself (payload, opt-in gating, ~monthly cadence,
  fire-and-forget failure handling) is unaffected.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Home page "Latest Additions" image count is now configurable
  (LG-31).** Previously hardcoded to 8, which frequently left an
  incomplete, visually stranded last row in the thumbnail grid at common
  viewport widths (an item count that doesn't divide evenly into a row's
  worth of columns always leaves a partial row — this is an inherent
  property of a fixed grid, not something CSS alone can cleanly fix without
  making the odd-one-out thumbnail a different size than its neighbors,
  which reads as visually inconsistent). Added a new `latest_images_count`
  config key (Admin → Configuration; default `8`, range `0`–`50`, `0` =
  hide the section) — an admin can now pick a count that divides evenly
  into their own theme's typical column count to avoid the sparse row
  entirely. Mirrors the existing `latest_albums_count` setting exactly in
  behavior and validation. The same setting also governs the "Latest
  Additions" count on category pages (LG-041), which had the identical `8`
  hardcoded separately — one setting now covers both.

- **Category pages now show a "Latest Additions" section, including images
  from sub-categories (LG-041).** Browsing into a category (`?cat=N`)
  previously showed only its direct albums and sub-categories, with no
  "what's new in here" signal. A new `GalleryService::getLatestImagesInCategorySubtree()`
  now surfaces the most recently added approved images (count governed by
  `latest_images_count`, see LG-31 below) from that
  category's own albums *and* every descendant sub-category's albums at
  any depth — an image added three levels down still shows up on the
  top-level category's page, not just its immediate parent. Same
  `approved`/public-album visibility gate as every other public image
  listing; no new permission surface.

- **New Album's Folder Path field now suggests existing unclaimed server
  folders (LG-040).** `admin/albums.php?action=new` previously required
  hand-typing the exact relative path of a folder already uploaded to
  `albums/` (e.g. via FTP) — a typo silently created a new, empty folder
  instead of attaching the album to the one holding the images. The Folder
  Path field now shows a visible, clickable list of on-disk folders under
  `albums/` that aren't yet claimed by any album (click one to fill the
  field), plus a `<datalist>` for typing-based autocomplete, both populated
  via a new `manage_albums`-gated AJAX endpoint, `admin/ajax_list_folders.php`,
  backed by `GalleryService::listAvailableAlbumFolders()`. The scan is strictly
  contained to `albums/` (every candidate is `realpath()`-verified against
  the resolved albums root, guarding against a symlink escaping it), skips
  hidden directories, and only offers a folder if it passes the exact same
  `lumora_sanitize_folder()` validation the form submit already enforces.
  Only leaf folders that directly contain at least one file are suggested —
  purely organizational parent folders (e.g. a show/season folder holding
  only subfolders) are walked into but never listed themselves, so a
  gallery with a deep show/season/episode structure doesn't drown its
  handful of real candidates in container-folder noise. Free-typing a new
  path and leaving the field blank (auto-generated numeric folder) are both
  unaffected — the suggestion list is purely additive.

- **Standardized PHPDoc file headers across the entire codebase (LG-039).**
  Every PHP source file now carries a consistent header block —
  `@package`, `@subpackage`, `@author`, `@copyright`, `@license`, `@link`,
  `@source`, and `@since` — placed after `declare(strict_types=1);`, to
  improve IDE support and documentation generation. `@since` reflects each
  file's actual version of introduction per the changelog/history record
  rather than a blanket default. Legacy forwarding-wrapper files
  (`include/template.php`, `include/thumb.php`) are now marked
  `@deprecated`, pointing readers to `ThemeRenderer::`/`ThumbnailService::`.
  No behavioral changes — comment headers only. `@see` cross-references to
  related classes (deferred in the initial pass) have since been added to
  28 files with a genuine, verified relationship — the service layer,
  migrations, and the three legacy wrapper files — rather than every file
  indiscriminately.

### Fixed

- **`?view=most_viewed&cat=N` returned nothing for a category with only
  sub-categories and no albums of its own (LG-33 gap).**
  `GalleryService::getMostViewedImages()`'s category scoping matched
  `a.category_id = ?` exactly, so a purely organizational parent category
  (e.g. a show's top-level category holding only "Season 1"/"Season 2"/etc.
  sub-categories, with every actual album living in those, not in the
  parent) always showed "No images to display" — even though its
  sub-categories were full of heavily-viewed images. It now scopes to the
  category's full descendant subtree at any depth, via the same
  `getCategorySubtreeIds()` helper LG-041 added, matching how "Latest
  Additions" already behaves on category pages.

- **classic-fansite's "Most Viewed" nav link never carried album/category
  context forward (LG-33 gap).** LG-33 made `ThemeRenderer::renderNav()`
  scope the "Most Viewed" link to the current album/category via a
  `{NAVIGATION}` template token — but classic-fansite's `template.html` had
  its own hardcoded nav markup (`<a class="fs-nav-link">...`) with no
  `{NAVIGATION}` token to plug into, so `?view=most_viewed&cat=`/`&album=`
  never appeared there; only the `default` theme ever benefited from LG-33.
  classic-fansite's nav now renders via `{NAVIGATION}` like the default
  theme does, with new CSS (`.fs-nav-inner .navbar-nav`/`.nav-item`/
  `.nav-link`) making the token's markup look identical to the previous
  hardcoded chips — no visual change, only the underlying link logic is now
  shared with the default theme instead of duplicated and out of sync.

## [1.13.0] — 2026-08-04

### Added

- **In-dashboard updates now download a curated release ZIP instead of
  GitHub's raw tag archive, when one is available (LG-36).**
  `GitHubUpdateProvider::mapRelease()` now looks for a release asset named
  `LumoraGallery-v{version}.zip` (case-insensitive) and uses its
  `browser_download_url` for `download_url`; releases cut without that asset
  still fall back to the previous raw-archive URL, so nothing breaks for
  older releases. The raw tag archive includes `.git*` files and other
  repo-internal content that shouldn't reach an end user's install.
  `GitHubUpdateProvider::parseChecksumAsset()`'s multi-entry checksum-file
  matching also had a latent bug fixed as part of this: it searched for the
  substring `lumora-v{version}`, which is not present in the new
  `LumoraGallery-v{version}.zip` filename (there's a `gallery-` in between),
  so a `sha256sums.txt`-style checksum asset would have silently failed to
  match once the curated ZIP shipped. The fragment is now
  `lumoragallery-v{version}`.

- **In-dashboard updates now remove obsolete files after a successful
  Replace stage (LG-37).** `UpdaterService::stageReplace()` copies the new
  release's files over `LUMORA_ROOT` incrementally without ever deleting
  anything — so a file renamed or removed between two releases previously
  stayed on disk forever. A durable manifest
  (`cache/.updates/file-manifest.json`, new `readFileManifest()`/
  `writeFileManifest()`) now records every file installed by the last
  successful Replace, and `removeObsoleteFiles()` deletes any manifest
  entry no longer present in the new release once it finishes copying.
  Scoped so it can never delete anything outside the application's own
  core files: a new `ALWAYS_PROTECTED` list (`config.php`, `albums/`,
  `cache/`) is checked independently of the stage's own `$preserve` array,
  and `$preserve` itself (which already includes `themes`/`plugins` when
  their preserve config is on) is also honored — so, for example, a theme
  file tracked from an earlier run where `update_preserve_themes` was off
  is never removed just because a later run has it preserved again. The
  very first update after this ships is always a safe no-op (no prior
  manifest to compare against); tracking simply begins from that install
  onward. `listFilesRecursive()`/`removeObsoleteFiles()` take an explicit
  root/preserve list rather than assuming `LUMORA_ROOT` internally
  (mirroring `copyDirectory()`'s own explicit `$dst`), so the new logic is
  unit-testable against throwaway fixture directories without touching the
  real application source tree, unlike `stageReplace()` itself.

- **Bulk Rename for images within an album (LG-26).** The Image Manager's
  per-album bulk-select toolbar (`admin/images.php`) gains a "✏️ Rename
  Selected" button (hidden in cross-album search results, since renaming is
  scoped to one album's folder) that hands the selected image IDs to a new
  page, `admin/rename.php`. There, an admin sets a naming pattern — Prefix,
  Suffix, and a Base pattern field supporting `{name}` (original filename)
  and `{num}` (a sequential number, with configurable start value and
  zero-padding width) — previews every resulting filename before anything
  changes, and only then applies it. The preview flags duplicate targets
  within the batch and collisions with any other image already in the
  album, refusing to apply until the pattern is adjusted. File extensions
  are always preserved automatically and are never part of the template.
  Applying renames both the original file and its thumbnail via a two-phase
  temp-name swap (old → unique temp → new) so that a pattern permuting
  existing filenames (e.g. two images trading names) can never collide
  mid-operation; any failure at any step rolls every touched file back to
  its original name and leaves the database untouched. Restricted to full
  `manage_images` permission holders (not `edit_own_images` contributors),
  since it can touch files beyond any one uploader's own images. New
  `GalleryService::getAlbumImagesByIds()` / `::getOtherAlbumFilenames()`
  query helpers and a new pure `lumora_build_rename_filename()` function
  (`include/functions.php`) back the feature.

### Changed

- **PhotoSwipe lightbox now leaves a 5% margin around large images instead of
  filling the viewport edge-to-edge.** Added a `paddingFn` to the PhotoSwipe init
  in `ThemeRenderer::renderLightboxJs()`, giving very large photos ~90% of the
  viewport instead of 100%. Applies to both bundled themes since the lightbox
  script is shared.
- **Clarified the naming and scope of the two update-related backups in the admin
  Updates page.** The automatic, per-update backup (`config.php` + a database dump,
  created before every update via `UpdaterService::stageBackup()`) is now consistently
  called the **update backup** throughout the UI (stage label, confirmation checkbox,
  "About Updates" notes, `Install Update` intro text) to distinguish it from the
  manual, on-demand **full backup** (`BackupService` — a ZIP of the whole codebase +
  config + a database dump). The manual-backup card is renamed from "Backups" to
  "Full Backups", and both cards now explain how they differ in scope from each
  other. No behavioural change — this is a wording/labelling clarification only.
- **Script homepage, GitHub repository, and install-ping URLs standardised to
  match sister script Lumora Press (LG-38).** The "Powered by" footer link
  (`ThemeRenderer::renderPoweredBy()`) and the README's Repository link now
  point at `https://coding.unloved-heart.net/scripts/lumoragallery` (was
  `.../scripts/lumora`). `GitHubUpdateProvider`'s default repository
  (`update_github_repo` config key's fallback, used for release checks,
  changelog links, and archive download URLs) is now
  `intothisshadow/LumoraGallery` (was `intothisshadow/Lumora`), matching the
  GitHub repository rename. The opt-in Anonymous Install Ping
  (`InstallPingService::ENDPOINT`) now sends to
  `https://coding.unloved-heart.net/lumoragallery/ping.php` (was
  `.../lumora/ping.php`).

## [1.12.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Collapsible Settings/Maintenance/Users sidebar sections (LG-32
  addendum).** Each of those three section headings in the admin sidebar
  (`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`) is now a toggle button with a
  rotating chevron indicating expanded/collapsed state; Gallery stays
  always-expanded and Dashboard has no header to collapse. State persists
  per-browser via `localStorage`, applied by an inline script immediately
  after the nav markup so there's no flash of the wrong state on load. A
  section containing the current page always renders expanded regardless
  of its stored state, so navigating to a page never hides its own nav
  item. New `.lum-admin-nav-toggle`/`.lum-admin-nav-chevron`/
  `.lum-admin-nav-group`/`.lum-admin-nav-sub` styles in `admin/admin.css`,
  including the existing mobile horizontal-scroll layout.
- **Opt-in LiteSpeed page caching for hosts without server-level cache
  config access (LG-033 follow-up).** Some shared/managed hosts (e.g.
  DirectAdmin without the LiteSpeed WebAdmin console) give admins no way to
  turn on LSCache page caching themselves. New `CacheHeaderService::recommendedPageCacheRules()` /
  `writePageCacheRules()` / `pageCacheStatus()` / `removePageCacheRules()`
  manage a second, independent `.htaccess` block (`CacheEnable public /` +
  a configurable `TTL`, `<IfModule LiteSpeed>`-gated) alongside the existing
  static-asset block — installable/removable one-click from a new "LiteSpeed
  Page Caching (Advanced)" card on the admin Installation page, with a TTL
  field and an explicit warning about the hit-counter/"Who Is Online"
  undercounting tradeoff inherent to page caching. New
  `litespeed_page_cache_ttl` config key (0 = disabled). Deliberately kept
  free of any database dependency (persisting the TTL is the caller's job,
  done by `admin/installation.php` after a successful write) so the class
  stays unit-testable without a DB connection, like the rest of
  `CacheHeaderService`.
- **Lazy PHP session start for public pages, and explicit admin LSCache
  exclusion (LG-033 follow-up).** `bootstrap.php` previously called
  `session_start()` unconditionally on every request; PHP's session cache
  limiter then sent `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate` and
  a `Set-Cookie` on every response, which meant LiteSpeed Cache (or any
  cache) could never actually cache a single page, defeating the point of
  the LSCache purge integration added just above. A session is now started
  eagerly only for admin-panel requests and requests that already carry a
  session cookie (an existing login, or an in-progress hit-count throttle);
  a first-time anonymous visitor to a public page gets no session, no
  `Set-Cookie`, and no no-cache headers, so the response is actually
  cacheable. New `lumora_ensure_session()` (`include/functions.php`) starts
  a session on demand for the few public code paths that need to write
  `$_SESSION` — `album.php`'s and `ajax_hit.php`'s hit-count throttling,
  `lumora_csrf_token()`, and `lumora_check_remember_cookie()`'s
  auto-login-on-return-visit path — all called immediately before the
  first `$_SESSION` write, matching the existing hardened cookie
  parameters. `lumora_is_logged_in()` and friends were already safe to call
  with no active session (`isset()`/`empty()` don't warn on an unset
  `$_SESSION`) and needed no changes. The admin panel keeps its previous
  always-on session and is additionally excluded from LSCache via a new
  `admin/.htaccess` (`CacheLookup off`, LiteSpeed-only, ignored elsewhere)
  as defense-in-depth beyond the implicit `Set-Cookie` exclusion.
- **LiteSpeed/OpenLiteSpeed detection and optional LSCache integration
  (LG-033).** New `ServerEnvironmentService::detect()` identifies LiteSpeed
  vs. OpenLiteSpeed/Apache/nginx/Caddy from `$_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE']`
  (falling back to the LSCache request marker when that string is absent),
  plus best-effort HTTP/2, HTTP/3, Brotli, and active-LSCache capability
  flags. The admin Installation page's System Information panel now shows
  the detected server (with a LiteSpeed badge) and those capabilities. New
  `CacheHeaderService` manages a clearly-delimited, additive
  `mod_expires`/`mod_headers` block in the site's root `.htaccess` — images/
  thumbnails/fonts served directly by the web server (there's no PHP script
  in that request path) get long-lived immutable caching, CSS/JS get a
  shorter window; the same block is read identically by Apache and
  LiteSpeed/OpenLiteSpeed, is a no-op on nginx/Caddy, and is installed/
  removed on demand from the Installation page without disturbing any other
  `.htaccess` content. A new opt-in, off-by-default `litespeed_cache_purge`
  config toggle (Admin → Configuration → Performance) makes Lumora send an
  `X-LiteSpeed-Purge: *` header after admin content changes — wired once, in
  `include/bootstrap.php`, for every admin-panel POST request (covering
  image/album/category/theme/configuration changes uniformly) rather than at
  each individual mutation call site; `CacheHeaderService::purgeLiteSpeedCache()`
  itself is a safe no-op unless both the toggle is on and LiteSpeed is
  detected, so this has no effect on any other server or with the toggle
  left off.
- **`?view=most_viewed` now respects the current album or category context
  (LG-33).** Previously, clicking "Most Viewed" while browsing an album or
  category always jumped to the gallery-wide most-viewed list, silently
  dropping that context. `GalleryService::getMostViewedImages()` gained
  optional `$album_id`/`$cat_id` filter parameters (album takes precedence
  when both are given), and `index.php`'s `?view=most_viewed` route now
  accepts `&album=ID` / `&cat=ID` to scope the query accordingly, with the
  page heading changing to "Most Viewed in This Album" / "Most Viewed in
  This Category" / "Most Viewed in Gallery" to match. `ThemeRenderer::renderNav()`
  gained matching optional `$album_id`/`$cat_id` parameters so the "Most
  Viewed" nav link itself carries the current context forward — `album.php`
  and `index.php`'s category route now pass their context in via a
  `{NAVIGATION}` token override, and the most-viewed view page passes its
  own context back through so the link stays scoped while browsing it.
- **Admin sidebar navigation reorganized into labeled sections (LG-32).**
  The flat, organically-grown nav list in `lum_admin_page()`
  (`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`) is now grouped under **Gallery**
  (Batch Add, Categories, Albums, Images), **Settings** (Configuration),
  **Maintenance** (Import, Updates, Tools, Installation), and **Users** (My
  Account, Users, Groups), with **Dashboard** remaining a standalone
  top-level item. Section headers are rendered as new `.lum-admin-nav-heading`
  list items (styled in `admin/admin.css`, including a mobile/horizontal-scroll
  variant) and are only shown when at least one item in that section is
  visible to the current user's role — per-item permission filtering and
  active-page highlighting are unchanged. The "Account" nav label was renamed
  to "My Account" to match its new placement under Users.
- **Admin → Updates page redesigned to align with FanUpdate Redux (TODO #10).**
  Rebuilt `admin/update.php` around a consolidated Installed/Status/Source
  metadata grid (adds a Database Schema Version indicator and an "Installed
  at" filesystem path), an interactive Latest Release card (stability badge,
  Markdown-rendered release notes via new `UpdateService::renderReleaseNotesHtml()`,
  a checksum verification bar, and a "Re-download release" action backed by
  new `UpdaterService::downloadStandalone()`), a Backups panel backed by a
  new `BackupService` class (full-installation ZIP snapshots of application
  code + configuration + a database dump, excluding `albums/` and `cache/`;
  create/restore/delete actions; up to 3 retained with automatic pruning), a
  System Status table (`UpdaterService::getSystemStatusChecks()` — PHP
  version, ZIP/cURL extensions, file permissions, disk space, temp directory)
  and an Update Settings form (release channel, automatic-check toggle,
  check frequency, optional GitHub token) persisted via four new config
  keys: `update_channel`, `update_check_frequency`, `update_auto_check`,
  `update_github_token`. `GitHubUpdateProvider` gained prerelease-channel
  support (queries the releases list instead of `/releases/latest` when the
  prerelease channel is selected) and optional Bearer-token auth for a
  higher GitHub API rate limit, plus a `getReleasesUrl()` method (also added
  to `AbstractUpdateProvider`'s interface). `UpdateService`'s cache TTL is
  now driven by the check-frequency setting (24h / 7 days) instead of a
  fixed constant. The multi-stage "Update Now" workflow, its AJAX endpoints,
  and the automatic Stage 4 backup are all unchanged.
- **Theme preview (`?theme=`) now persists across category and album
  navigation (TODO #9).** The admin-only preview mechanism itself already
  covered every frontend page type (`index.php`'s home/category views and
  `album.php`) through one centralised resolver, but clicking any internal
  gallery link would silently drop back to the real active theme on the very
  next page load, since none of the generated hrefs carried the `theme`
  query parameter forward. Added `lumora_theme_preview_link()`
  (`include/functions.php`), a no-op pass-through unless a valid preview is
  active for the current request, and routed every internal URL-building
  function through it: `ThemeRenderer::renderNav()`, `::renderBreadcrumb()`,
  `::renderCatgrid()`, `::renderCatlist()`, `::renderSortControls()`, and
  `lumora_pagination()` (which threads it through `prev_url`/`next_url` and
  every `sprintf($url_pattern, ...)` page-number link built from it), plus
  the home page's "View all" link. Ordinary page loads with no active
  preview are completely unaffected.

### Fixed

- **Configuration page's "Save Settings" button looked scoped to the last
  card on the page (LG-34).** It sat inside "Upload & Image Limits" at the
  very bottom of `admin/config.php`'s single page-wide `<form>`, which made
  it read as though it only saved that one card's fields — despite actually
  submitting every setting above it — and had already caused at least one
  real instance of changes going unsaved. Moved it into its own dedicated
  card below all the settings cards (still inside the same `<form>`, so the
  save behavior itself is unchanged), relabeled "Save Settings" →
  "Save All Settings" with an explicit "Saves every setting on this page"
  line, and gave it a distinct `.lum-adm-save-bar` style (`admin/admin.css`)
  — an accent border and tinted background — so it reads as a page-level
  action rather than another plain section card.

- **`include/template.php` fatal-on-call dead code left behind by the TODO #30
  removal.** That session removed `ThemeRenderer::customHeader()`/`customFooter()`
  entirely, but missed the two forwarding wrappers in `include/template.php`
  (`lumora_custom_header()`/`lumora_custom_footer()`) that called them —
  `template.php` wasn't in that ticket's own file list, since its role as a
  legacy-wrapper layer over `ThemeRenderer` was overlooked. Nothing in the
  current codebase calls either wrapper (no bundled or custom theme defines a
  `theme.php` override, and the `{CUSTOM_HEADER}`/`{CUSTOM_FOOTER}` template
  tokens that would have prompted a call were already removed from every
  `template.html` in the same session), so this was latent rather than an
  active bug — but calling either function today would be a fatal "call to
  undefined method" error. Removed both wrappers from `include/template.php`.

### Removed

- **"Custom HTML (optional)" config feature removed** (Custom Header File Path /
  Custom Footer File Path, and the `{CUSTOM_HEADER}`/`{CUSTOM_FOOTER}` template
  tokens). This feature had no real users — all four existing custom themes
  hardcode their topnav/banner markup directly in `template.html` rather than
  using `custom_header_path`/`custom_footer_path`, which is now the sanctioned
  customisation point for markup like this going forward. Removed
  `ThemeRenderer::customHeader()`/`customFooter()`/`loadCustomFile()`, the
  `{CUSTOM_HEADER}`/`{CUSTOM_FOOTER}` tokens from `renderPage()`, the
  "Custom HTML (optional)" card and its two fields from Admin → Configuration
  (along with the `custom_header_path`/`custom_footer_path` whitelist entries
  in both the save and import actions), and the literal `{CUSTOM_HEADER}`/
  `{CUSTOM_FOOTER}` tokens from every bundled and custom theme's
  `template.html`. Existing installations that already set
  `custom_header_path`/`custom_footer_path` retain two harmless, unread rows
  in `{PREFIX}config` — left in place deliberately rather than adding a
  migration purely to delete unread config rows.

### Fixed

- **Classic Fansite theme: section titles ("Recently Updated", "Categories",
  "Latest Additions") rendered unreadably dark against their coloured
  background bar.** `.lum-section-title` and the Typography section's
  `.fs-main h1, .fs-main h2, ...` rule both targeted the same element (section
  titles are rendered as `<h2>`s in `index.php`), and the heading rule's
  higher specificity (one class + one element vs. one class alone) was
  silently winning, overriding the intended light `--fs-section-text` colour
  with the dark `--fs-head-text` heading colour. Fixed by scoping the rule to
  `.fs-main .lum-section-title` (two classes), which now correctly outranks
  the heading rule. No other styling changed.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-07-13

### Changed

- **Update check now goes through the GitHub Releases provider exclusively
  (TODO #12).** `UpdateService` previously queried its own separate, hardcoded
  JSON endpoint (`coding.unloved-heart.net/lumora/update.json`) to determine
  whether a new release was available, entirely independent of the
  `GitHubUpdateProvider`/`AbstractUpdateProvider` abstraction the in-dashboard
  updater (`UpdaterService`) already used for download URLs and SHA-256
  checksums — two separate sources of truth that could in principle disagree.
  `UpdateService::fetch()` now delegates to
  `AbstractUpdateProvider::createFromConfig()`, so release discovery, download
  URL, and checksum verification all come from the same GitHub-backed source.
  The old endpoint dependency has been removed entirely. `AbstractUpdateProvider`
  gained a `getSourceLabel()` method (the configured `owner/repo` for
  `GitHubUpdateProvider`) so the admin Updates page's "About Updates" panel can
  show the release source in place of the retired endpoint URL. The repository
  queried remains configurable via the existing `update_github_repo` config key.

### Added

- **Admin-only theme preview via URL.** A logged-in administrator can now
  append `?theme=folder-name` to the public gallery URL to render any
  installed theme for that request only — no other visitor is affected and
  the site's configured theme is never written to. An invalid or unknown
  theme name falls back to the real active theme with an admin-only notice
  explaining why; a valid preview shows a similar admin-only banner
  reminding them it's temporary and visible only to them. Every asset URL
  (`{THEME_URL}`, `template.html`, an optional `theme.php` override) already
  resolves through the same `lumora_active_theme()` call this hooks into, so
  no other rendering code needed to change. Admin → Configuration's Themes
  table gained a **Preview** column/button per theme that opens the preview
  in a new tab.
- **Copyable image info box in the frontend lightbox (Admin/Staff only).**
  Logged-in staff (admin, moderator, or contributor) now see an extra button
  in the PhotoSwipe lightbox toolbar that opens a small panel with the
  current image's direct URL and a ready-to-paste
  `<a href="..."><img ... /></a>` embed snippet (thumbnail image linking to
  the full-size original), plus a one-click **Copy HTML** button with a
  brief "Copied!" confirmation. Regular visitors never see the button or
  panel. New `.lum-lightbox-info*` styles added to both bundled themes'
  `style.css`, styled to match PhotoSwipe's own always-dark chrome rather
  than the site's light/dark colour mode.
- **Drag-and-drop reordering for categories and albums in the admin panel.**
  `admin/categories.php`'s hierarchy tree and `admin/albums.php`'s hierarchy
  view rows can now be dragged to reorder. Categories can additionally be
  dragged directly onto another category to reparent them (with a guard
  against moving a category into one of its own descendants); albums can be
  reordered only within their existing category. New
  `GalleryService::reorderCategories()`/`reorderAlbums()` persist the new
  `pos` values (and, for categories, the new `parent_id`), backed by two new
  AJAX endpoints (`admin/ajax_reorder_categories.php`,
  `admin/ajax_reorder_albums.php`). A small toast shows saving/error
  feedback while a reorder request is in flight.
- **Opt-in anonymous install ping.** A new, off-by-default **Privacy**
  section in Admin → Configuration lets an administrator opt in to sending
  a minimal, anonymous ping (a randomly generated install UUID, the Lumora
  version, and the PHP version — nothing else) to a dedicated endpoint,
  roughly once a month plus once immediately on enabling the feature. Fully
  independent of the existing update-check request; fails silently on any
  network error. New `InstallPingService` class.

### Fixed

- **Dark mode: accent colour used as link/border text failed WCAG AA contrast
  against dark surfaces in both built-in themes.** Classic Fansite's
  `--fs-accent` (`#4a1f6e`, a near-black purple) was reused unchanged as the
  dark-mode link colour, giving roughly 1.2:1 contrast against the dark
  content background — links, card titles, breadcrumbs, pagination, and
  category-list numbers were all barely legible. Default theme's
  `--lum-accent` (`#0d6efd`) was borderline too, at ~3.9:1, just under the
  4.5:1 normal-text threshold. Both themes now have a separate
  `--lum-accent-ink`/`--lum-accent-ink-hover` (Default) and
  `--fs-accent-ink`/`--fs-accent-ink-hover` (Classic Fansite) token pair —
  identical to the accent colour in light mode, swapped for a lighter,
  WCAG AA-verified tint in dark mode (5.8:1–7.3:1 against every dark surface
  in use) — and every text/link/border use of the accent colour now goes
  through these tokens. Filled backgrounds (buttons, section headers, the
  category-list header bar) are unaffected, since white text on a dark
  accent fill was never the contrast problem.
- **Dark mode: no visible keyboard focus outline in either built-in theme.**
  Neither theme defined an explicit `:focus-visible` style, relying on
  browser/Bootstrap defaults that can disappear against the dark navbar (both
  modes) or dark-mode content panels. Added a theme-aware `:focus-visible`
  outline (new `--lum-focus-ring`/`--fs-focus-ring` tokens, adaptive per
  colour mode) across both themes' interactive elements, plus a fixed
  light-coloured outline for the navbar/footer since those stay dark in both
  modes.
- **Category dropdown in the album creation/edit form (`admin/albums.php?action=new`)
  displayed categories in the wrong hierarchical order**, making a category
  appear as if it belonged under a completely unrelated category (e.g. three
  "Photos" categories rendering as if nested under "Season 3 Screencaps"
  instead of their own actual parent). The underlying cause:
  `getAllCategoriesFlat()`'s SQL order (`ORDER BY parent_id ASC, pos ASC, name
  ASC`) groups categories purely by their numeric `parent_id` value, not by
  where their real parent sits in the list, so a category could visually end
  up adjacent to an unrelated one; the dropdown's own indent logic only ever
  checked "has *a* parent" (one dash) rather than the real nesting depth.
  Added `GalleryService::getAllCategoriesTreeOrdered()`, which walks the
  category tree depth-first from the root and returns every category with a
  computed `depth`, so every child is placed immediately after its own
  parent at the correct indent level, at any nesting depth. Both
  `admin/albums.php`'s Category dropdown and `admin/categories.php`'s Parent
  Category dropdown (same underlying bug, same fix) now use this instead of
  the flat, unordered list.

### Changed

- **Update confirmation checkbox on `admin/update.php` is now visually
  prominent.** The "I understand that this will replace application files…"
  checkbox previously blended into the surrounding text as a plain small
  form-check. It now sits inside a bordered, tinted callout box (new
  `.lum-upd-confirm-box` style in `admin/admin.css`, with a light-mode and
  dark-mode colour pair) with a larger checkbox, bold label text, and a
  warning icon, so administrators are far less likely to overlook it before
  starting an update that replaces application files. Label association,
  checkbox id, and the JS that gates the "Update Now" button on it are all
  unchanged.
- **`admin/config.php` reorganised into clearly separated sections.** Each
  former `<h6>` sub-heading (Appearance, Images & Thumbnails, Custom HTML,
  Gallery Behavior, Upload & Image Limits) — plus a new "Basic Information"
  heading for the previously header-less top fields — is now its own
  `.lum-adm-card` with a prominent `<h5>` heading and a dedicated inline SVG
  icon, matching the section-card layout already used by `admin/tools.php`
  and `admin/installation.php`. New shared `.lum-adm-section-title` /
  `.lum-adm-section-icon` styles added to `admin/admin.css` for this and any
  future admin page. All field names, ids, `required`/`min`/`max`
  validation attributes, and the single shared `<form>` submission are
  unchanged — this is a layout-only change.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **`LUMORA_DB_VERSION` was stale at `9`** (`version.php`) despite the schema
  having reached version 13 as of `Migration0007_CreateGroupsTables`
  (matching `install/schema.sql`'s own "Version: 13" header) — the constant
  was simply never incremented across Migrations 0004–0007. Doesn't affect
  `SchemaService`, which determines pending migrations purely from
  discovered migration files vs. the `{PREFIX}migrations` tracking table
  and never reads this constant, but it is included verbatim in
  `InstallationService::exportSettings()`'s diagnostic JSON snapshot, where
  it would have misreported the database version to anyone using that
  export. Bumped to `13` to match reality; found while bumping the version
  for this release.

- **`GalleryService::getImageNeighbours()` was broken for every call, on any
  sort order** (`include/services/GalleryService.php`): its query selected
  from `{PREFIX}images` with no table alias, while every `$sort` branch's
  `ORDER BY` clause referenced an `i.` alias that didn't exist — producing
  `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 'i.pos'` (or `i.added_at`/`i.hits`/
  `i.filename` for the other sort options) on every single invocation.
  Found only once the full test suite was actually executed end-to-end for
  the first time; the existing prev/next-neighbour tests had apparently
  never been run to completion before. Fixed by adding the missing alias.
- **`LumoraDB::commit()`/`rollBack()` could throw "There is no active
  transaction"** (`include/db.php`) when a DDL statement (`CREATE`/`ALTER`/
  `DROP TABLE`) executed anywhere inside an open transaction — MySQL/MariaDB
  implicitly commits on DDL, which PDO's own `inTransaction()` correctly
  reflects, but the wrapper's outermost `commit()`/`rollBack()` call didn't
  check for that before calling the real PDO method, and PDO throws when
  asked to commit/roll back a transaction it no longer considers active.
  Both methods now guard with `inTransaction()` first. Most visible in any
  workflow that runs schema migrations (which are inherently DDL-heavy)
  inside a wrapping transaction.
- **Coppermine config parser silently failed on double-quoted array keys**
  (`plugins/coppermine-importer/CoppermineConfigDetector.php`): the
  extraction regex only matched `$CONFIG['key']` (single-quoted key), never
  `$CONFIG["key"]` (double-quoted key), even though it already correctly
  handled either quote style for the *value*. A real Coppermine
  `config.inc.php` using double-quoted keys — valid, if less common, PHP
  syntax — would be rejected entirely as "not a valid Coppermine config"
  despite containing every required setting. The key delimiter now accepts
  either quote character (backreferenced so the closing bracket must match
  the opening one).
- **`lumora_sanitize_folder()` could leave a `..` substring in its output**
  (`include/functions.php`) when a disallowed character (e.g. a null byte)
  sat directly between two segments with no slash separator — stripping it
  by deletion could fuse the segments together (e.g. `"albums\0../../etc"`
  collapsing to `"albums../etc"`), and `"albums.."` isn't caught by the
  segment-level `!== '..'` filter since it's a different string, even though
  it still contains `..` as a substring. Disallowed characters are now
  replaced with a path separator instead of deleted, guaranteeing every
  stripped character still produces a segment boundary so a `..` segment is
  always seen as its own complete segment when one was present. Not
  independently exploitable as a real traversal (a segment like `"albums.."`
  is just an ordinary directory name to the filesystem, not a parent-
  directory reference), but worth closing given how security-sensitive this
  function is.

- **`Migration0003_UpdateUsersTableForRoles` no longer unconditionally
  re-narrows `users`.`role` to a fixed ENUM** (`include/migrations/Migration0003_UpdateUsersTableForRoles.php`):
  the legacy-role-rename and ENUM-redefinition steps previously ran on every
  invocation with no guard, unlike the migration's own `is_active` column
  step. On an install where `role` has already been widened to `varchar(50)`
  by `Migration0007_CreateGroupsTables` (to hold any custom group slug, not
  just the three original system roles), re-running or replaying
  `Migration0003` would silently convert `role` back to
  `enum('admin','moderator','contributor')`, which would reject or truncate
  any custom group slug. Found while exercising every migration in numeric
  order against an already-fully-migrated schema. The steps now only run
  when `role` is still detected in its pre-v9 shape (an `enum` containing
  `'editor'`); already-migrated or already-widened installs are left
  untouched.
- **`LumoraDB` transactions are now nesting-safe** (`include/db.php`):
  `beginTransaction()`/`commit()`/`rollBack()` previously called the
  underlying `PDO` methods directly, which throws a `PDOException` ("There
  is already an active transaction") on PHP 8+ if a second
  `beginTransaction()` is called while one is already open — for example, a
  service method that wraps its own writes in a transaction
  (`GroupService::createGroup()`, `AlbumAssignmentService::setAssignedAlbums()`,
  etc.) being called from another context that has already opened one. The
  three methods now track a nesting depth: only the outermost
  `beginTransaction()`/`commit()`/`rollBack()` touches the real PDO
  transaction, and any inner calls use named `SAVEPOINT`/`RELEASE
  SAVEPOINT`/`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` statements instead (supported by
  InnoDB), so nested calls compose safely rather than throwing.
- **Bulk image move now scoped to a contributor's assigned albums**
  (`admin/images.php`, `admin/ajax_image_move.php`): a contributor with
  `edit_own_images` (not `manage_albums`) previously saw every album in the
  bulk "Move Selected" target dropdown, even though ownership already
  restricted *which images* they could select. The move-target dropdown is
  now filtered to `AlbumAssignmentService::getAssignedAlbumIds()` (mirroring
  the existing batch-add album scoping in `admin/batch.php`), with a clear
  empty-state notice and a disabled control when no other assigned album
  exists. `ajax_image_move.php` re-validates the posted `target_album_id`
  server-side via `AlbumAssignmentService::userCanAccessAlbum()` so a
  contributor cannot move images into an unassigned album by editing the
  request directly. Admin/moderator (`manage_albums`) behaviour is
  unchanged — every album remains a valid move target. See TODO §22.

### Added

- **Coppermine importer now assigns image ownership** (`plugins/coppermine-importer/CoppermineImporter.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/index.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/ajax_import.php`): every image imported
  from a Coppermine gallery now has its `uploaded_by` column populated
  instead of being left at `0` ("no recorded owner"). The preview/options
  step of the import wizard (step 2) shows an "Assign imported images to"
  dropdown listing active Lumora users, defaulting to the administrator
  currently running the import; the chosen user ID is validated server-side
  and carried through the session-based import state to every
  `import_images` chunk. A future user-mapping import (importing Coppermine
  accounts and matching them to Lumora users) could preserve original
  per-image ownership instead of this single-owner default — see TODO #20.

### Changed

- **Album/category create, edit, and delete moved into `GalleryService`**
  (`admin/albums.php`, `admin/categories.php`,
  `include/services/GalleryService.php`): this logic previously lived
  inline in the two admin page scripts (direct `LumoraDB::insert()`/
  `update()`/`delete()` calls) — the one place in the admin panel that
  didn't follow the project's service-layer convention. Six new methods
  (`createAlbum()`, `updateAlbum()`, `deleteAlbum()`, `createCategory()`,
  `updateCategory()`, `deleteCategory()`) now own every behavioral rule
  (folder auto-generation and uniqueness checking, `thumb_image_id`
  validation, cascading delete of images/assignments, empty-folder-only
  on-disk removal, self-parent prevention, reparenting children/albums on
  category delete); the two pages now only handle permission checks, CSRF
  validation, request parsing, flash messages, and redirects. Purely an
  internal refactor — behavior, flash-message text, and redirect targets
  are unchanged from the admin's perspective.
- **Core themes expanded for full custom styling** (`themes/default/style.css`,
  `themes/classic-fansite/style.css`): both stylesheets are now organised under
  named section banners (Layout, Typography, Navigation, Albums & Categories,
  Image Pages, Forms, Buttons, Tables, Messages, Utility Components, Media,
  Loading indicator, Print styles, Responsive) so every public-facing
  component can be restyled from CSS alone, without touching PHP templates.
  Added CSS-only building blocks for components that don't have a page yet
  (forms, tables, alerts, buttons, panels, dividers, badges, a hover-overlay
  utility for thumbnails/cards, a loading spinner, and a print stylesheet
  that hides site chrome for clean image printing), all driven by each
  theme's existing colour variables so dark mode keeps working automatically.
  No visual output changed and no PHP files were touched.
- **`color-scheme: light dark` support added** (`themes/default/style.css`,
  `themes/classic-fansite/style.css`): both themes now declare
  `color-scheme: light dark;` in their light `:root` block and override it to
  `color-scheme: dark;` inside their `html[data-bs-theme="dark"]` block, so
  native browser UI (scrollbars, form control chrome, date pickers) matches
  the active colour mode instead of always rendering light.

### Documentation

- **New theme development guide** (`docs/THEME_DEVELOPMENT.md`, linked from
  `README.md`): documents the full dark mode architecture
  (`{COLOR_MODE_INIT}` / `{COLOR_MODE_TOGGLE}` tokens, preference resolution
  order, the `data-bs-theme` attribute mechanism), a minimal dark-mode-ready
  theme example, guidance on inheriting the standard `--lum-*` / `--fs-*`
  variable-naming conventions instead of hard-coding colours, an
  accessibility checklist (contrast, icons, forms/buttons, focus outlines,
  hover states, code/tables/captions, modals) to run through before shipping
  a theme, and recipes for smooth colour-mode transitions, a theme-aware
  logo swap, and print styles.

### Security

- **Private albums are now actually access-controlled**
  (`include/services/GalleryService.php`, `album.php`): `getAlbum()` gained
  a `$public_only` parameter; `album.php` now passes `!lumora_is_admin()`
  so a "Private (hidden)" album returns the same 404 as a nonexistent one
  for any visitor who isn't staff, instead of being fully viewable by
  anyone who guesses/enumerates its numeric ID. Previously, "Private" only
  hid an album from navigation and category listings, not from direct
  access. See `TODO-security.md` #1.
- **`view_updates` no longer allows performing updates**
  (`admin/ajax_update_perform.php`, `admin/update.php`): the endpoint that
  downloads/extracts release archives, replaces application files, runs
  database migrations, and can roll back or abort an update now requires
  the `site_configuration` permission, matching `ajax_run_migrations.php`,
  instead of the more widely-grantable `view_updates`. A custom permission
  group holding only `view_updates` (e.g. for read-only status monitoring)
  can no longer trigger the full update pipeline. `admin/update.php`'s
  "Install Update" card and "Run Database Update" button now show a
  read-only notice instead of an interactive control when the current user
  lacks `site_configuration`. See `TODO-security.md` #2.
- **Open redirect fixed on login** (`admin/login.php`, `include/functions.php`):
  new `lumora_safe_redirect_target()` helper rejects protocol-relative
  `redirect` values like `//evil.com` (which pass a naive
  `str_starts_with($redirect, '/')` check but browsers treat as an
  off-site redirect), in addition to the existing same-site-only check.
  See `TODO-security.md` #3.
- **Installer `?force=1` reinstall now requires authentication**
  (`install/index.php`): forcing a reinstall over an already-installed site
  previously bypassed the "already installed" guard with nothing but an
  unauthenticated query parameter — the only remaining protection was the
  `install/` directory having been deleted, which the installer's own code
  acknowledges commonly fails for FTP-deployed sites. `?force=1` now
  requires a session already holding the `site_configuration` permission
  against the site's *existing* database (bootstrap.php loads config.php
  and auth.php whenever config.php exists, even inside the installer),
  redirecting to `admin/login.php` otherwise. See `TODO-security.md` #4.
- **Password recovery no longer hardcoded to `role = 'admin'`**
  (`admin/forgot_password.php`): the recovery lookup now finds the oldest
  user belonging to any group holding both `user_management` and
  `site_configuration` (via `GroupService`), instead of matching the
  literal `admin` slug. Recovery now keeps working even if the primary
  administrator's account has been moved to a custom group with
  equivalent permissions. See `TODO-security.md` #5.
- **Login rate limiter TOCTOU race closed** (`admin/login.php`): the
  separate unlocked read / `LOCK_EX`-only write of
  `cache/.login_ratelimit.json` were replaced with a single
  `$rl_with_lock()` helper that holds one exclusive `flock()` across the
  entire read-prune-decide-write cycle, so concurrent requests from the
  same IP can no longer each observe a stale failure count and slip past
  the lockout together. See `TODO-security.md` #6.
- **Album-assignment eligibility generalised beyond the `'contributor'`
  slug** (`include/services/AlbumAssignmentService.php`,
  `admin/user_albums.php`, `admin/users.php`): `assignAlbum()`,
  `setAssignedAlbums()`, and the "Assign Albums" UI now check the
  `manage_assigned_albums` permission via `GroupService`/`UserService`
  rather than the literal `contributor` role slug, so a custom permission
  group with that permission works identically to the built-in
  contributor group. See `TODO-security.md` #7.
- **Removed dead `@`-suppressed code block** (`admin/migrate.php`): an
  inert, unreachable block that violated the project's own
  no-`@`-suppression convention has been deleted. See `TODO-security.md` #8.
- **Coppermine importer's table prefix is now sanitised**
  (`plugins/coppermine-importer/CoppermineImporter.php`): the
  admin-supplied source-database table prefix is stripped to
  `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` before being interpolated into SQL identifiers, matching
  the core installer's own `db_prefix` validation. See `TODO-security.md` #9.
- **Coppermine config-detector AJAX no longer leaks exception internals**
  (`plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/ajax_detect_config.php`): the outer
  catch-all previously returned the exception's class name, message, file
  path, and line number directly in the JSON response. It now logs full
  details server-side via `error_log()` and `MigrationService::logEvent()`
  and returns a generic error message to the client. See
  `TODO-security.md` #10.
- **Config import now enforces the same validation as manual save**
  (`admin/config.php`, `include/services/LumoraConfig.php`): the config
  export/import feature previously stored imported values with only a
  key-name whitelist check, skipping the enum/range validation the manual
  settings form applies (e.g. `log_mode`, `category_layout`, `timezone`).
  A new `LumoraConfig::sanitizeValue()` method centralises this validation;
  both the `save` and `import` actions in `admin/config.php` now call it,
  so a hand-edited or corrupted export file can no longer store an
  out-of-range or unrecognised config value. See `TODO-security.md` #11.

### Added

- **User Group Management** (`include/services/GroupService.php`,
  `include/migrations/Migration0007_CreateGroupsTables.php`,
  `include/services/UserService.php`, `include/auth.php`, `include/bootstrap.php`,
  `admin/groups.php`, `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`, `install/schema.sql`):
  Roles are now dynamic permission groups instead of a fixed
  admin/moderator/contributor ENUM. New `{PREFIX}groups` and
  `{PREFIX}group_permissions` tables (Migration0007, DB version 13) back a new
  `GroupService` with `getAllGroups()`, `getGroup()`, `getGroupBySlug()`,
  `groupExists()`, `getGroupPermissions()`, `groupHasPermission()`,
  `createGroup()`, `renameGroup()`, `updateGroupPermissions()`, and
  `deleteGroup()`. `{PREFIX}users`.`role` is widened from an ENUM to a
  `varchar(50)` referencing a group slug.

  The three system groups (admin, moderator, contributor) are seeded with the
  exact permission sets that were previously hardcoded in
  `UserService::ROLE_PERMISSIONS` — both by Migration0007 for upgrades and
  directly in `install/schema.sql` for fresh installs — so no installation
  sees a behavioural change until an administrator deliberately edits a
  group. `UserService::roleHasPermission()`, `getRolePermissions()`,
  `roleOptions()`, and `roleBadge()` now delegate to `GroupService`, so every
  existing caller (`admin/users.php`, `include/auth.php`'s remember-me session
  restore, `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`'s sidebar filtering,
  `AlbumAssignmentService`) keeps working unchanged. `GroupService` falls
  back to the legacy hardcoded three-role behaviour on installations pending
  Migration0007, so nothing breaks before the migration is run.

  New admin page `admin/groups.php` (gated on `user_management`, reachable via
  a new "Groups" sidebar item next to Users) lists every group with its
  permission count and current user count; supports creating custom groups,
  renaming any group, granting/revoking individual permissions per group, and
  deleting unused custom groups. Safeguards: the three system groups can
  never be deleted; a group with one or more user accounts still assigned to
  it cannot be deleted until they're reassigned from Admin → Users; the
  `admin` system group can never lose the `user_management` or
  `site_configuration` permissions — `GroupService::updateGroupPermissions()`
  silently re-adds them if a submitted form omits either one, so
  administrators can never lock themselves out of Users/Groups or
  Configuration. Permission changes take effect immediately for every user in
  the affected group on their next request.

- **Per-Image Ownership Enforcement** (`include/migrations/Migration0006_AddUploadedByToImages.php`,
  `include/services/GalleryService.php`, `include/services/ThumbnailService.php`,
  `include/thumb.php`, `include/auth.php`, `admin/images.php`, `admin/ajax_image_delete.php`,
  `admin/ajax_image_move.php`, `admin/ajax_image_rethumb.php`, `admin/ajax_batch.php`,
  `install/schema.sql`): The `edit_own_images` permission (contributor role) is now
  enforced at the row level instead of only at the page level. A new `uploaded_by`
  column on `{PREFIX}images` (Migration0006, DB version 12) records which user uploaded
  each image; all pre-existing images are backfilled to the primary administrator
  account during the migration so ownership is never left undefined. New
  `GalleryService::imageBelongsToUser()` is the single source of truth for ownership
  checks, used by a new `lumora_require_image_access(int $imageId)` helper in
  `include/auth.php` (mirroring `lumora_require_album_access()`).

  `admin/images.php` now scopes its list, cross-album search, edit, save, and delete
  actions to a contributor's own uploads only — never another user's images, and never
  bypassable by guessing an image ID in the URL. Two new `GalleryService` methods,
  `getAdminAlbumImages()` and `countAdminAlbumImages()`, replace the page's previous
  inline SQL for the plain (non-search) per-album listing so the ownership filter is
  applied consistently through the service layer; `searchImages()` and
  `countSearchImages()` gained a matching optional `$owner_id` parameter. The bulk AJAX
  handlers (`ajax_image_delete.php`, `ajax_image_move.php`) check ownership per image ID
  rather than gating the whole request, so one unauthorised ID in a bulk selection is
  skipped with a per-item error instead of aborting the entire call;
  `ajax_image_rethumb.php` (single image) returns an unauthorised JSON error immediately.
  `ThumbnailService::batchAddImage()` (and its `include/thumb.php` wrapper) gained an
  `$uploaded_by` parameter, and `admin/ajax_batch.php` now passes the current session
  user's ID so every new Batch Add upload is automatically attributed to its uploader.

  Left unchanged/out of scope: the Coppermine importer plugin does not record an
  uploader on imported rows (admin-only tool, unaffected by this permission); the bulk
  move target-album dropdown still lists every album regardless of the contributor's
  album assignments.

- **Contributor Album Assignments** (`include/services/AlbumAssignmentService.php`,
  `include/migrations/Migration0005_CreateAlbumAssignmentsTable.php`, `include/auth.php`,
  `admin/albums.php`, `admin/batch.php`, `admin/ajax_batch.php`, `admin/users.php`,
  `admin/user_albums.php`, `install/schema.sql`): Implements the `manage_assigned_albums`
  permission that was previously defined but unused. A new `{PREFIX}album_assignments`
  table (Migration0005, DB version 11) records which albums an administrator or
  moderator has granted a contributor account access to. New `AlbumAssignmentService`
  provides `assignAlbum()`, `unassignAlbum()`, `setAssignedAlbums()`,
  `getAssignedAlbumIds()`, `getAssignedAlbums()`, `userCanAccessAlbum()` (the single
  source of truth for album-scoped access checks), `getAssignedUsers()`,
  `countAssignedAlbums()`, and cascade-cleanup methods called from
  `UserService::deleteUser()` and `admin/albums.php`'s delete handler. A new
  `lumora_require_album_access(int $albumId)` helper in `include/auth.php` re-validates
  access to a specific album server-side (not just filters a dropdown), used by
  `admin/albums.php`, `admin/batch.php`, and `admin/ajax_batch.php`.

  `admin/albums.php` now serves three list modes: the existing hierarchy/flat views
  for `manage_albums` holders are unchanged; a new flat "assigned albums" view shows
  contributors only their assigned albums, with no New Album button, no category
  filter, and no per-row Delete button. Contributors can edit an assigned album's
  metadata and cover image but not reassign its category (shown as read-only text) or
  create/delete albums. The album edit screen shows a "Assigned to: …" line (visible
  to `manage_albums` holders only) when the album has contributor assignments.
  `admin/batch.php`'s album picker is scoped to assigned albums for contributors, with
  both the dropdown and the `?album=` GET parameter re-validated server-side; the same
  re-validation was added to `admin/ajax_batch.php`.

  New page **`admin/user_albums.php`** (gated on `manage_albums`, reachable via a new
  "Assign Albums" button next to contributor rows on `admin/users.php` and a
  "Manage Assigned Albums" card on the edit-user screen) presents every album as a
  filterable, checkable list and saves the full assignment set in one call via
  `setAssignedAlbums()`. `admin/users.php`'s user list shows each contributor's current
  assignment count next to their role badge. `install/schema.sql`'s migration-notes
  header also gained the previously-undocumented DB version 9→10 entry for
  Migration0004 (`color_mode`), closing a documentation gap from the prior session.

  Explicitly out of scope for this change (tracked in TODO.md §18): per-row image
  ownership ("edit own uploads") and category management for contributors.

- **User Management — page-level access enforcement** (`include/auth.php`,
  `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`, `admin/login.php`, `admin/index.php`, and every
  admin page / AJAX handler): Moderator and contributor accounts can now log in to the
  admin panel (previously `login.php` accepted only the `admin` role). Three new helpers
  in `include/auth.php` — `lumora_require_login()`, `lumora_require_permission()`, and
  `lumora_require_any_permission()` — enforce page-level access using the existing
  role→permission mapping in `UserService::ROLE_PERMISSIONS`; a shared `lumora_forbidden()`
  helper renders a 403 page for authenticated users who lack the required permission.
  Every admin page and its supporting AJAX handlers were switched from a blanket
  `lumora_require_admin()` check to the permission that matches its function (e.g.
  `albums.php` / `categories.php` → `manage_albums`, `images.php` and its image AJAX
  handlers → `manage_images` or `edit_own_images`, `tools.php` and its maintenance AJAX
  handlers → `maintenance_tools`, `batch.php` / `ajax_batch.php` → `batch_add`).
  Site configuration, installation, import, user management, and update pages remain
  admin-only. The admin sidebar navigation (`lum_admin_page()`) now hides items the
  current user's role does not grant access to, and the dashboard's Quick Links card
  (`admin/dashboard.php`) only shows the shortcut buttons the current role can actually
  use. The remember-me persistent-login cookie now works for all three roles instead of
  admin only.

- **Optional theme and plugin replacement during core upgrade** (`admin/update.php`,
  `admin/ajax_update_perform.php`, `include/services/UpdaterService.php`): Two unchecked
  checkboxes now appear in the Install Update confirmation area — one for plugins, one for
  themes. By default both remain unchecked so existing custom themes and plugins are always
  preserved. When checked, the selection is stored in the update lock file and honoured
  during the Replace stage; the persistent `update_preserve_themes` / `update_preserve_plugins`
  config values are never modified. The progress log now reports whether themes/plugins were
  preserved or replaced (and whether the replacement was user-requested or config-driven).

- **Dark mode support** (`admin/admin.css`, `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`,
  `admin/config.php`, `admin/ajax_color_mode.php`,
  `include/services/ThemeRenderer.php`,
  `themes/default/style.css`, `themes/default/template.html`,
  `themes/classic-fansite/style.css`, `themes/classic-fansite/template.html`,
  custom themes): Full light / dark / auto colour-scheme support for both the public gallery
  and the admin panel. Bootstrap 5.3's built-in dark-mode theming (`data-bs-theme`) is
  used for all framework components; a set of CSS custom properties (`--lum-*` / `--fs-*`)
  adapts every custom gallery component. An inline `<script>` placed as the first element
  in `<head>` reads the stored preference before any CSS is parsed, preventing
  flash-of-wrong-theme. The preference cycles Auto (follow OS) → Dark → Light → Auto via
  a ☀️ / 🌙 / 🖥️ toggle button in each theme's navigation bar and the admin topbar.
  Preference is stored in `localStorage`; for logged-in administrators it is additionally
  synced to the new `{PREFIX}users.color_mode` column (`auto` / `light` / `dark`,
  default `auto`) via `admin/ajax_color_mode.php` so the choice persists across devices.
  A new **Default Colour Mode** selector in Admin → Configuration sets the site-wide
  fallback for first-time visitors whose `localStorage` is empty.
  The Xena custom theme already had `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` support;
  `html[data-bs-theme="dark"]` equivalents have been added so the explicit toggle works
  even when the system preference is light. All four custom themes received additive
  `html[data-bs-theme="dark"]` override blocks covering thumbnail captions, card info
  rows, category list headers, breadcrumbs, and interactive states.

- **Database migration 0004** (`include/migrations/Migration0004_AddColorModeToUsers.php`):
  Adds `color_mode ENUM('auto','light','dark') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'auto'` to `{PREFIX}users`.

## [1.9.2] — 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Category description styling** (`index.php`, `themes/default/style.css`,
  `themes/classic-fansite/style.css`): Category descriptions on category pages are now
  rendered with a `lum-cat-desc` class instead of a plain `text-muted` paragraph. Both
  themes style the block with a left accent border, subtle background tint, padded text,
  and relaxed line-height — matching the established `.lum-album-desc` pattern.

- **Hierarchy tree view in Album Manager** (`admin/albums.php`, `GalleryService.php`,
  `admin/admin.css`): The Albums page now opens in a hierarchy view by default. Albums
  are grouped under their category, with subcategories indented beneath their parent
  using a `└ ` connector glyph and 20 px depth steps. Uncategorized albums appear at
  the top in a dedicated *(No Category)* section. Each category section header shows
  the category name in bold with a badge indicating the number of direct albums.
  The hierarchy is built in PHP from two queries (`getAllCategoriesWithCounts` and
  `getAllAdminAlbumsGrouped`); a ref-array cycle guard prevents infinite recursion on
  corrupt `parent_id` values. When a search term or category filter is applied, the
  page falls back to the existing flat paginated table (with full search, per-page
  selector, and pagination) and a ✕ Clear button returns to hierarchy mode.
  New helper functions `render_album_row()` and `render_album_tree()` encapsulate the
  tree rendering; the flat-mode row loop and all management actions (edit, batch add,
  manage images, view, delete) are preserved unchanged.

- **Hierarchy tree view in Category Manager** (`admin/categories.php`, `GalleryService.php`,
  `admin/admin.css`): The Categories page now displays all categories as a full
  parent/child tree instead of a flat paginated list. Root categories appear at the
  top level; child categories are indented beneath their parent with a `└ ` connector
  glyph (20 px per depth level). Each row shows the category name, a badge with the
  number of direct albums, the position value, and Edit / Delete buttons — all actions
  continue to work exactly as before. A subcategory count indicator *(N ↳)* appears
  alongside the name when a category has direct children. The tree is built from a
  single `getAllCategoriesWithCounts()` query (a superset of the previous flat-list
  query, adding `album_count` and `subcategory_count` aggregates). The same data
  drives both the tree view and the new/edit parent dropdown, eliminating a second
  query. A ref-array cycle guard in `render_category_tree_rows()` protects against
  corrupt `parent_id` values. Pagination is removed from the list view; the complete
  tree is always shown.

- **Album description styling** (`album.php`, `themes/default/style.css`,
  `themes/classic-fansite/style.css`): Album descriptions are now rendered with a
  `lum-album-desc` class instead of a plain `text-muted` paragraph. Both themes style
  the block with a left accent border, subtle background tint, padded text, and
  relaxed line-height, giving descriptions a clear visual identity on the album page.

- **Album name search in Album Manager** (`admin/albums.php`, `GalleryService.php`):
  A search field now appears above the album list. Administrators can type part or
  all of an album name to instantly narrow the list to matching albums (case-insensitive
  partial match via a parameterized `LIKE` query on `a.title`). When a search is active,
  the summary line shows the match count and term (e.g. "12 albums matching **xena**").
  A ✕ Clear button resets the list. Submitting an empty search also returns the full list.
  The search query is preserved in pagination links and the per-page selector so the
  filtered view survives page navigation and page-size changes. When no albums match,
  a friendly inline message with a Clear link is shown in the table body. The service
  layer (`countAdminAlbums` and `getAdminAlbums`) now accept an optional `$search`
  parameter built with a dynamic WHERE clause, keeping the path clear for adding
  additional filter fields (e.g. category, visibility) in the future.

  

### Fixed

- **Album card descriptions no longer cut off** (`themes/default/style.css`,
  `themes/classic-fansite/style.css`): The `.lum-card-desc` rule previously applied
  `-webkit-line-clamp: 2`, truncating album and category descriptions in the card grid
  to two lines. The clamp has been removed so the full description is always visible.

- **Album card descriptions now styled** (`include/services/ThemeRenderer.php`):
  Album descriptions in the card grid were rendered with `class="lum-card-desc
  text-muted small mb-0"` — plain Bootstrap utility classes that produced unstyled
  grey text. The renderer now picks the correct semantic class per item type:
  `.lum-album-desc` for album cards and `.lum-cat-desc` for category cards, so
  descriptions in the grid receive the same left-border, background-tint, and
  padding styling applied everywhere else.

### Changed

- **Albums shown before sub-categories on category pages** (`index.php`): Within a
  category, albums are now listed first, followed by sub-categories. Previously
  sub-categories appeared above albums.

- **Admin sidebar: Users link moved after Account** (`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`):
  The Users item now appears at the bottom of the sidebar navigation, after Account,
  grouping user-management separately from the main gallery workflow items.

- **Coppermine Importer version corrected to v1.3.0** (`plugins/coppermine-importer/version.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/plugin.json`): The plugin had been bumped to v1.3.0 in code
  but all documentation (CHANGELOG, HISTORY.md) still referenced v1.2.0. All references
  corrected to v1.3.0 to match the actual plugin files.

- **CHANGELOG.md structural repair**: A previous editing session left v1.9.0 content
  (Staff Account Management, Auto-delete install/ via UpdaterService, Coppermine auto-detect)
  without a proper `### Added` section header in the [1.9.0] entry. Added the missing
  header to restore correct CHANGELOG structure.

---

## [1.9.1] — 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **Bug #1 — Select All checkbox in Image Manager** (`admin/images.php`):
  The "Select All" button did nothing. Root cause: all three attempts relied on
  JavaScript event listeners registered after the fact (`addEventListener`,
  `DOMContentLoaded`). If anything prevented the listener from being attached
  (script timing, a silent error, or a browser quirk), the click handler would
  simply not exist. Fix: removed all event-listener registration and rewrote the
  entire interactive layer as globally-defined functions (`lumSelAll`,
  `lumUpdCount`, `lumBulkDelete`, `lumBulkMove`, `lumSingleDelete`,
  `lumRethumb`) invoked directly via `onclick`/`onchange` attributes on the
  buttons and checkboxes. Global functions defined in a `<script>` block are
  unconditionally available to inline handlers by the time the user can click
  anything, eliminating all timing dependencies.

  A secondary bug caused the `<script>` block to fail silently: a `\n` escape
  sequence inside a PHP heredoc is a literal newline (same as in double-quoted
  strings). The `confirm()` call in `lumBulkDelete` contained `'...files?\n\nThis
  cannot be undone.'`, which PHP rendered as two real newline characters inside
  a JavaScript single-quoted string — an unconditional `SyntaxError` that
  prevented the entire script block from parsing, so no global functions were
  ever defined. Fixed by doubling the backslash (`\\n`) so PHP outputs the
  two-character sequence `\n` that JavaScript interprets as an escape.

  A third bug was also fixed: the per-row delete confirmation message was
  passed via `json_encode()` into a double-quoted HTML `onclick` attribute.
  `json_encode()` wraps its output in double quotes, which terminated the
  HTML attribute prematurely. Fixed by storing the message in a
  `data-confirm` attribute (HTML-escaped with `h()`) and reading it back
  via `this.dataset.confirm` in the onclick handler.

- **Bug #2 — Auto-delete install/ directory** (`install/index.php`,
  `include/services/UpdaterService.php`, `admin/update.php`):
  The installer's `ins_delete_installer()` returned `false` immediately on the
  first `unlink()` failure (common on Windows, or when FTP-uploaded files are
  owned by a different user than the PHP process). Files beyond the first were
  never attempted and the directory was left intact.

  Fix: (1) `@chmod($file, 0666)` is called before each `@unlink()` to handle
  cases where the PHP process owns the files but they have restrictive
  permissions; (2) all files are attempted regardless of individual failures;
  (3) if the directory still exists after deletion attempts, `index.php` is
  overwritten with a one-line PHP redirect (`header('Location: ../'); exit`).
  This neutralises the reinstallation risk even when the web server cannot
  delete FTP-owned files — visiting `install/` will redirect to the gallery
  root instead of serving the wizard. The completion page message was updated
  to explain this fallback to the user.

  The updater's `stageCleanup()` also pre-checks `is_writable()` and provides
  a specific failure reason in the log. A persistent security notice on every
  admin page (already present in `admin_helpers.php`) and on the Updates page
  (`admin/update.php`) continues to prompt manual removal if the directory
  survives.

- **Bug #3 — ℹ icon in update.php** (`admin/update.php`):
  Replaced the plain Unicode text character `ℹ` (U+2139) in the "About Updates"
  section heading with `ℹ️` (U+2139 + U+FE0F variation selector), which renders
  as a colour emoji matching the style of all other section headings on the page
  (`⬆`, `🗄`, `🔄`, `📋`).

### Changed

- **Theme CSS standardised to `style.css`** (`themes/default/`, `themes/classic-fansite/`):
  Renamed `lumora.css` → `style.css` in the default theme and `fansite.css` → `style.css`
  in the classic-fansite theme. Both `template.html` files updated to reference
  `style.css`. Internal block-comment filename annotations in both CSS files updated.
  `custom.css` in classic-fansite is unchanged.
  `themes/classic-fansite/README.md` and the root `README.md` updated to reflect the
  new filenames throughout. `lumora_theme_primary_stylesheet()` requires no change as
  it discovers the primary stylesheet dynamically from `template.html`.



---

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Staff Account Management — User Management UI** 

  **`UserService`** (`include/services/UserService.php`) — new static service class
  loaded by bootstrap.php. Responsibilities:

  - Role constants (`ROLES`, `ROLE_LABELS`) and the permission framework
    (`ROLE_PERMISSIONS`, `roleHasPermission()`, `getRolePermissions()`,
    `currentUserHasPermission()`) providing the foundation for per-page role
    gates as non-admin roles gain admin panel access in future phases.
  - `createUser()` — validates username/password/email/role, enforces uniqueness,
    hashes password with `PASSWORD_BCRYPT` cost 12.
  - `updateUser()` — updates username, email, and/or role with full validation.
  - `resetPassword()` — admin-initiated password reset (no current-password check);
    revokes all remember-me tokens to force a fresh login on all devices.
  - `setActive()` — enables or disables an account; guards against deactivating
    the last active administrator.
  - `deleteUser()` — permanently deletes an account; guards against self-deletion
    and deleting the last administrator; clears remember-me and reset tokens first.
  - `getPaginatedUsers()` / `countUsers()` — sorted by role priority then username.
  - `getUser()` — fetch a single user row by ID.
  - `roleBadge()` / `roleOptions()` — Bootstrap badge HTML and `<option>` list
    helpers used by the admin page.

  **`admin/users.php`** — new admin page accessible at **Admin → Users**.
  Three views served from a single file:
  - **User list** (default): paginated table (10/25/50 per page, session-persisted)
    showing ID, username, role badge, email, active/disabled status badge, last
    login, and per-row Edit / Enable–Disable / Delete actions. A **“+ New User”**
    button and per-page selector sit above the table. Confirm dialog for delete.
    Disabled rows show a secondary badge. “You” badge marks the current admin's
    own row; their Enable/Disable and Delete buttons are disabled client-side and
    rejected server-side.
  - **Create user** (`?action=new`): username, optional email, role selector with
    live role-description text, password + confirm fields with live match indicator.
    Role reference card beside the form explains each role's permissions.
  - **Edit user** (`?action=edit&id=N`): profile form (username, email, role —
    role selector disabled when editing own account); account info summary (status,
    role badge, last login, member since); reset-password sub-form (no current
    password required); Enable/Disable toggle and Delete button (both disabled
    when editing own account).
    All POST actions validate CSRF. Redirects keep the user on the correct view
    after success or failure.
    A migration guard checks `Migration0003_UpdateUsersTableForRoles` and shows a
    friendly prompt linking to the Updates page if the migration hasn't run yet.

  **`Migration0003_UpdateUsersTableForRoles`**
  (`include/migrations/Migration0003_UpdateUsersTableForRoles.php`):
  - `up()`: adds `is_active tinyint UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 1` to `{PREFIX}users`
    after the `email` column; migrates legacy `'editor'` → `'moderator'` and
    `'viewer'` → `'contributor'` before modifying the ENUM; updates the `role`
    ENUM to `('admin','moderator','contributor')` with default `'contributor'`.
  - `down()`: reverses the ENUM, renames roles back, drops `is_active`.
  - `tableExists()` / `columnExists()` guards make both directions idempotent.

  **`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`** — **Users** (👥) nav item added between
  Dashboard and Batch Add.

  **`include/auth.php`** — three changes:
  - Header comment updated to reflect multi-user role support.
  - `lumora_login()`: rejects disabled accounts — returns null when
    `is_active = 0`. The `isset()` guard keeps the check safe on pre-v9 installs
    where `SELECT *` returns no `is_active` key.
  - `lumora_check_remember_cookie()`: also rejects disabled accounts in the user
    row check `($user['role'] !== 'admin' || disabled account)`.
  - New `lumora_has_permission(string $permission): bool` — delegates to
    `UserService::currentUserHasPermission()`; provides the public API for
    future per-page permission gates.

  **`include/bootstrap.php`** — `UserService.php` added to the step 7 service
  class load sequence; header comment updated.

  **`install/schema.sql`** (DB version 9) — `{PREFIX}users` table updated with
  `is_active` column and the new role ENUM. Migration comment for v8 → v9
  added at the top. Version header bumped to 9.

  **`version.php`** — `LUMORA_DB_VERSION` bumped from 8 to 9.

  **Roles and permissions defined:**

  | Role | Label | Permissions |
  |------|-------|-------------|
  | `admin` | Administrator | site_configuration, user_management, manage_albums, manage_images, moderate_comments, maintenance_tools, batch_add, view_updates |
  | `moderator` | Moderator | manage_albums, manage_images, moderate_comments, maintenance_tools |
  | `contributor` | Contributor | batch_add, edit_own_images, manage_assigned_albums |

  Page-level permission enforcement for moderator and contributor roles
  (restricting access to their respective admin pages) is the next phase of
  this feature.

  **Schema migration (DB v8 → v9):**
  ```sql
  -- Run via Admin → Updates → Run Database Update, or manually:
  ALTER TABLE `lum_users`
    ADD COLUMN `is_active` tinyint UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
      COMMENT '1 = active, 0 = disabled'
    AFTER `email`;
  
  UPDATE `lum_users` SET `role` = 'moderator'   WHERE `role` = 'editor';
  UPDATE `lum_users` SET `role` = 'contributor' WHERE `role` = 'viewer';
  
  ALTER TABLE `lum_users`
    MODIFY COLUMN `role`
      enum('admin','moderator','contributor') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'contributor';
  ```
  Replace `lum_` with your actual table prefix. Existing installations already
  running with only an `admin`-role account (the installer default) are
  completely unaffected by the role migration UPDATEs, which are no-ops.

- **Auto-delete `install/` directory after successful upgrade**
  (`include/services/UpdaterService.php`):
  `stageCleanup()` now automatically removes the `install/` directory when an
  upgrade completes successfully.  Uses the existing `removeDirectory()` helper;
  a success or failure detail line is added to the cleanup stage log so
  administrators can see the outcome in the progress UI.  A warning is logged
  if removal fails (e.g. restrictive filesystem permissions), and the existing
  per-page security banner in `admin_helpers.php` remains visible until the
  directory is gone.  Completes TODO item 1.

- **Coppermine Importer — Auto-detect database settings** (`plugins/coppermine-importer/CoppermineConfigDetector.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/ajax_detect_config.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/index.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/sync_metadata.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/version.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/plugin.json`):
  Completes TODO item 3. Adds an **Auto-Detect from Coppermine Installation** panel
  to the credentials step of both the main import wizard and the Metadata Sync tool.
  The panel reads `include/config.inc.php` from a supplied filesystem path and
  pre-fills all five database fields (host, name, user, password, prefix) in one
  click — no more copy-pasting credentials from a text editor.

  **`CoppermineConfigDetector`** (`CoppermineConfigDetector.php`) — new static
  service class. Responsibilities:
  - `findInstallations(string $root): list<string>` — searches the supplied path
    for readable `include/config.inc.php` files. Handles three cases: (1) the path
    IS a config file, (2) the path is the CPG root (has `include/config.inc.php`
    directly), and (3) the path is a parent directory — scanning subdirectories up
    to 4 levels deep while skipping `albums/`, `themes/`, `.git/`, and similar
    non-installation directories. Returns all found paths so multiple co-hosted
    installations are surfaced for selection. Symbolic links are not followed.
  - `parseConfig(string $config_path): array` — reads the config file as **plain
    text** (never `include`d or `eval`'d). Strips block comments and single-line
    comments, then extracts `$CONFIG['key'] = 'value';` assignments via regex
    supporting both single- and double-quoted strings with backslash-escape
    handling. Returns `{dbserver, dbname, dbuser, dbpass, TABLE_PREFIX}`. Throws
    `RuntimeException` on file-not-found, permission errors, oversized files
    (> 1 MiB), and missing required keys. **Exception messages never contain
    credential values.**
  - `hasConfigFile(string $root): bool` — non-destructive existence check.

  **`ajax_detect_config.php`** — new AJAX-only endpoint. Two actions:
  - `find`: accepts `cpg_path` POST param; calls `findInstallations()`; on a
    single find parses and returns the full config (including password, for
    form pre-fill); on multiple finds stores the paths **in session** and returns
    only metadata (dbname, dbserver, relative path) without passwords.
  - `select`: accepts an integer `select_index` POST param; resolves it against
    the server-side session list (client cannot supply a path directly); parses
    and returns the full config. Session candidate list is cleared after use.
    Enforces CSRF and admin authentication on every request. Passwords never appear
    in error messages, server logs, or the multi-install list response.

  **UI changes (both `admin/index.php` and `admin/sync_metadata.php`):**
  - An **Auto-Detect from Coppermine Installation** card appears above the
    credentials form with a path input (pre-filled from the last successful
    detection, shared across tools via `$_SESSION['lumora_cpg_last_detect_path']`)
    and a **Detect Settings** button. Enter triggers detection too.
  - On a **single installation found**: form fields are populated immediately;
    a green ✓ status line prompts the admin to review before clicking Test Connection.
  - On **multiple installations found**: a selection list is shown with each
    installation's relative path and database name. A **Use Selected Installation**
    button loads the chosen config into the form.
  - On **error**: a red ✗ status line shows the server error message.
  - All form fields remain fully editable after detection so values can be
    corrected before connecting.
  - Both files updated to `require_once CoppermineConfigDetector.php`.
  - Plugin bumped to **v1.3.0** (`version.php`, `plugin.json`).

### Security

- **Login rate limiting** (`admin/login.php`): added IP-based brute-force
  protection. Failed attempts are tracked in `cache/.login_ratelimit.json`
  using a 15-minute sliding window. After 5 failures the form is disableds
  client-side, a 2-second server-side delay is enforced, and a lockout message
  is shown. Every individual failure also adds a 1-second `usleep()` delay.
  IP record is cleared on successful authentication.

- **Password-change timing hardening** (`admin/account.php`): added
  `usleep(500_000)` on `password_verify()` failure in the password-change
  handler to slow brute-force attempts against the current-password field.

- **ZipArchive path traversal protection** (`include/services/UpdaterService.php`):
  `stageExtract()` now performs a two-layer path-traversal check: (1) enhanced
  pre-extraction string validation including null-byte rejection; (2) new
  post-extraction `realpath()` scan verifying every extracted path resolves
  within the canonical extraction directory — cleans up and aborts on any escape.

- **File upload double-extension bypass fix** (`include/services/ThumbnailService.php`):
  `isAllowedImage()` now rejects any filename containing a server-executable
  extension (`php`, `php3`, `php4`, `php5`, `php7`, `phtml`, `phar`, `shtml`) in
  any dot-separated segment, not just the last extension. `scanNewImages()` updated
  to use `isAllowedImage()` consistently.

- **GD image dimension bomb protection** (`include/services/ThumbnailService.php`):
  `thumbGd()` now validates source image dimensions from `getimagesize()` before
  calling any `imagecreatefrom*()` function. Rejects images exceeding 50 MP total
  pixels or 15 000 px on either axis, preventing memory exhaustion from crafted
  image headers.

- **Backup SQL identifier escaping** (`include/services/UpdaterService.php`):
  `dumpDatabase()` now applies `str_replace('`', '``', $table)` before
  interpolating table names into `SHOW CREATE TABLE` and `SELECT *` queries,
  ensuring correct escaping of any table name that contains a backtick character.

- **Security audit Phase A false-positive documentation**: full code review of
  all 57 files flagged by the 2026-06-25 PHP Security Scanner confirmed that
  the overwhelming majority of "Critical" SQL injection and "High" CSRF findings
  were scanner false positives (scanner fired on `require_once`, `echo
  json_encode()`, `lumora_int()`-guarded reads, and the CSRF-check lines
  themselves). All genuine issues are addressed in this release.

### Added

- **Admin Tool: Installation Settings** (`include/services/InstallationService.php`,
  `admin/installation.php`,
  `admin/ajax_installation_health.php`,
  `include/migrations/Migration0002_CreateConfigChangesTable.php`,
  `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`,
  `include/bootstrap.php`,
  `install/schema.sql`,
  `version.php`):
  Completes TODO item 2. Administrators can now update Lumora's installation
  configuration after moving to a new domain, subdirectory, or server — without
  manually editing config.php or running raw SQL. Accessible via the new
  **Administration → Installation** sidebar item.

  **`InstallationService`** (`include/services/InstallationService.php`) — new
  static service class loaded by bootstrap.php. Responsibilities:
  - `detectEnvironment()` — reads live PHP superglobals to determine the current
    protocol, host, and Lumora web-root path; returns `detected_url`, `root_path`,
    `albums_path`, `cache_path`, `php_version`, `web_server`, and `https` flag.
    Respects common reverse-proxy headers (`HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO`, `SERVER_PORT`).
  - `getStoredConfig()` — returns the installation-relevant subset of the stored
    configuration: `base_url`, `gallery_name`, `db_host`, `db_name`, `db_prefix`.
    DB credentials are never returned.
  - `detectChanges()` — compares detected vs. stored values and returns a list of
    mismatch descriptors (field, label, stored, detected). Also surfaces an HTTPS
    upgrade hint when the stored URL still uses `http://` but the current connection
    is served over TLS.
  - `validateUrl(string $url)` — validates scheme, format, and non-emptiness.
  - `applySettings(array $settings, int $user_id, string $username, string $ip)` —
    validates and persists each allowed config key (`base_url` in this version),
    calls `logConfigChange()` per key, clears application caches, and reloads the
    in-memory config. Returns `{success, applied[], errors[]}`.
  - `clearCaches()` — deletes non-hidden files in `cache/`, calls `opcache_reset()`
    if available, and calls `LumoraConfig::load()` to refresh the in-memory cache.
  - `runHealthCheck()` — runs nine checks and returns a list of result descriptors
    (`name`, `status`, `detail`, `ok`). Checks: database connectivity, albums
    directory accessible and writable, cache directory writable, config.php present,
    site URL stored and valid, PHP version ≥ 8.2, image processor (Imagick / GD),
    PDO MySQL extension, ZipArchive extension.
  - `logConfigChange(...)` — inserts one row into `{PREFIX}config_changes`. Fails
    silently on pre-v8 installs where the table does not yet exist.
  - `getRecentChanges(int $limit)` — queries `{PREFIX}config_changes` newest-first;
    returns empty array gracefully on pre-v8 installs.
  - `exportSettings()` — returns a JSON snapshot of current stored config and live
    environment (DB password excluded; labelled `*** not exported ***`).

  **`admin/installation.php`** — new admin page with six sections:
  - **Current Installation Information** — a read-only table showing stored vs.
    detected site URL (with HTTPS badge), application root, albums and cache
    directory paths with writable indicators, DB host/name/prefix (read-only),
    PHP version, and web server string. Includes an “Export Snapshot (JSON)”
    button that POSTs to the same page and triggers a JSON download.
  - **Auto-Detected Changes** — shown only when `InstallationService::detectChanges()`
    finds a mismatch. Renders a comparison table (stored vs. detected) and a
    “Copy detected URL into the form” button that pre-fills the update form.
  - **Migration Helpers** — Bootstrap 5 accordion with four scenario cards:
    *Domain Change* (replaces the hostname while preserving scheme, port, and path),
    *Subdirectory Change* (replaces the path component), *HTTPS Enablement*
    (replaces `http://` with `https://`), and *Server Migration* (accepts a
    complete new URL). Each card has a helper input and an “Apply to form” button
    that populates the Site URL field below without submitting.
  - **Update Installation Settings** — a form with the Site URL field (pre-filled
    with the stored value), a live change-preview notice (JS-driven, shows old →
    new before submit), collapsible rollback instructions, and a
    *Current Password* field (required). Submitting without the correct password
    is rejected server-side and no changes are applied.
  - **Health Check** — an AJAX-driven panel. Clicking “Run Health Check” POSTs to
    `ajax_installation_health.php` and renders the nine-row results table with
    per-check OK/WARNING/FAIL badges. A summary banner (all clear vs. attention
    needed) appears above the table.
  - **Configuration Change Log** — a table of the last 15 entries from
    `{PREFIX}config_changes`, showing timestamp, admin, IP, setting key, previous
    value (struck through in red), and new value (green). Empty-state message
    shown on first visit.

  **`admin/ajax_installation_health.php`** — POST-only AJAX endpoint. Validates
  admin authentication and CSRF token, then calls
  `InstallationService::runHealthCheck()` and returns
  `{checks: [...], all_ok: bool}` JSON. Returns HTTP 403 on auth or CSRF failure,
  HTTP 405 on non-POST requests, HTTP 500 on unexpected errors.

  **`Migration0002_CreateConfigChangesTable`**
  (`include/migrations/Migration0002_CreateConfigChangesTable.php`) — second
  schema migration. `up()` creates `{PREFIX}config_changes` with `CREATE TABLE IF
  NOT EXISTS`; `down()` drops it. Picked up automatically by `SchemaService` and
  shown as pending in the admin Updates page until applied.

  **`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`** (extended) — **Installation** (🖥️) nav
  item added between Tools and Import in the sidebar.

  **`include/bootstrap.php`** (extended) — `InstallationService.php` added to the
  step 7 service class load sequence; header comment updated.

  **`install/schema.sql`** (DB version 8) — `{PREFIX}config_changes` table added.
  Migration comment for v7 → v8 added at the top of the file with the manual
  `CREATE TABLE` statement for existing installations.

  **`version.php`** — `LUMORA_DB_VERSION` bumped from 7 to 8.

  **New DB table** `{PREFIX}config_changes` (DB version 8):
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `lum_config_changes` (
    `id`         bigint UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `user_id`    int UNSIGNED    NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    `username`   varchar(50)     NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    `ip`         varchar(45)     NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    `key`        varchar(64)     NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    `old_value`  text            NOT NULL,
    `new_value`  text            NOT NULL,
    `changed_at` datetime        NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    KEY `key_changed`  (`key`, `changed_at`),
    KEY `user_changed` (`user_id`, `changed_at`)
  ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
  ```
  Replace `lum_` with your actual table prefix. Existing installations not yet
  running Migration0002 degrade gracefully — `logConfigChange()` and
  `getRecentChanges()` both catch `\Throwable` and fail silently.

- **Dashboard Update System — Phase 2** (`include/services/AbstractUpdateProvider.php`,
  `include/services/GitHubUpdateProvider.php`,
  `include/services/UpdaterService.php`,
  `admin/ajax_update_perform.php`,
  `admin/update.php`,
  `include/bootstrap.php`,
  `include/functions.php`):
  Completes TODO item 12. Administrators can now install a new Lumora release entirely
  from within the admin dashboard — no SSH, no manual file extraction. The workflow
  runs as a sequence of discrete AJAX stages, each reported in real time, with
  automatic backup and one-click rollback on failure.

  **Stage flow:**
  `preflight → download → verify → backup → maintenance → extract → validate → replace → migrate → cleanup`

  Each stage is one POST to `admin/ajax_update_perform.php`, returning
  `{success, stage, message, next, details[]}`. The browser drives the sequence
  recursively; a 300 ms pause between stages keeps the progress UI visible.

  **`AbstractUpdateProvider`** (`include/services/AbstractUpdateProvider.php`) —
  abstract base class defining the provider interface: `fetchMetadata()`,
  `buildArchiveUrl()`, `getName()`. The static factory `createFromConfig()` reads
  the `update_provider_type` config key (`'github'` by default) and instantiates
  the appropriate concrete class. New release sources (self-hosted servers,
  alternative repositories, private enterprise feeds) can be added by implementing
  this class and registering a match arm in the factory — no changes to the core
  update workflow are required. Includes a shared `httpGet()` helper that uses
  a stream context with `set_error_handler` / `restore_error_handler` instead of
  the `@` operator for clean E_WARNING suppression on TCP failures.

  **`GitHubUpdateProvider`** (`include/services/GitHubUpdateProvider.php`) —
  concrete provider for the GitHub Releases API
  (`https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest`). Maps
  `tag_name → latest_version`, `published_at → release_date` (date only),
  `body → release_notes` (truncated to 2 000 chars), `html_url → changelog_url`.
  Extracts `minimum_php` and `minimum_db` via regex from the release body
  (e.g. `Minimum PHP: 8.2`). Searches release assets for a `.sha256` /
  `sha256sums.txt` / `checksums.txt` file and fetches its content to supply the
  `sha256` checksum. Repository configurable via `update_github_repo` config key
  (default: `intothisshadow/Lumora`).

  **`UpdaterService`** (`include/services/UpdaterService.php`) — static service
  class orchestrating the full 10-stage update workflow. Key design points:
  - A JSON lock file at `cache/.updates/lock.json` persists state (target version,
    download URL, SHA-256, paths, maintenance flag) across AJAX calls so no state
    travels as POST parameters.
  - `runStage(string $stage, string $version = ''): array` dispatches to one of
    ten private stage methods; `set_time_limit(180)` applied per stage.
  - **Pre-flight** (`stagePreflight`): checks `ext-zip`, PHP version compatibility
    against cached update metadata, disk space (≥ 80 MB), and write permission;
    fetches download URL + SHA-256 from the configured provider; acquires lock.
  - **Download** (`stageDownload`): streams archive via `file_get_contents` with
    a 120 s timeout and up to 5 redirects; resumes if archive already exists.
  - **Verify** (`stageVerify`): validates SHA-256 checksum when available (logged
    as a warning when absent — checksums protect against corruption; cryptographic
    signatures are a planned future enhancement); confirms ZIP structure via
    `ZipArchive::count()`.
  - **Backup** (`stageBackup`): copies `config.php`; dumps all prefixed tables to
    `cache/.updates/backup/database.sql` via PDO (100-row chunks; string-literal-
    aware SQL splitter for restore).
  - **Maintenance** (`stageMaintenance`): writes a flag file
    (`cache/.updates/.maintenance_active`) and calls
    `LumoraConfig::set('gallery_offline', '1')`.
  - **Extract** (`stageExtract`): validates all ZIP entry names for path-traversal
    patterns before extracting a single byte; cleans any prior extract dir first.
  - **Validate** (`stageValidate`): locates the Lumora app root inside the archive
    (searches up to 3 directory levels for `version.php`); confirms required paths
    exist; verifies the declared version string; stores resolved path in lock file.
  - **Replace** (`stageReplace`): copies files from the extracted root to
    `LUMORA_ROOT`, skipping always-preserved paths (`config.php`, `albums/`,
    `cache/`) and optionally-preserved paths (`themes/`, `plugins/` — controlled
    by `update_preserve_themes` / `update_preserve_plugins` config keys).
  - **Migrate** (`stageMigrate`): calls `SchemaService::runPendingMigrations()`
    and surfaces individual migration names and any errors.
  - **Cleanup** (`stageCleanup`): calls `opcache_reset()`, clears cache files
    (non-hidden files in `cache/` root only), disables maintenance mode, releases
    lock. Also called (with `$success = false`) during rollback.
  - `rollback()`: restores `config.php` and database from backup, then calls
    `stageCleanup(false)`. File-level rollback is noted as a future enhancement;
    administrators are advised to maintain server-level file backups.
  - `forceAbort()`: disables maintenance mode and releases lock without restoration
    — for stuck sessions where no file replacement has occurred.
  - `logUpdate()` / `getUpdateLog()`: append-only log at `cache/.updates/update.log`.
  - `recordUpdateHistory()` / `getUpdateHistory()`: last 10 update attempts stored
    as JSON in the `update_history` config key.

  **`admin/ajax_update_perform.php`** — AJAX endpoint. Actions: `run_stage`,
  `rollback`, `abort`. Validates CSRF token and admin session. Version input
  sanitised with `/^v?[0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)*$/`. Unknown stages or actions return
  HTTP 400 with a JSON error.

  **`admin/update.php`** (extended) — the existing Updates page gains two new cards:
  - **⬆ Install Update** (shown only when an update is available): confirmation
    checkbox that must be ticked before the **Update Now** button enables; PHP
    version compatibility warning when the new release requires a higher PHP
    version; a 10-row stage progress list with pending/active/done/failed icons
    (⊙/⟳/✓/✗); a scrollable detail log panel; Rollback and Abort buttons that
    appear on failure. A stuck-session detection notice with an abort option is
    shown when the lock file is held but the current browser did not initiate it.
  - **📋 Update History**: table of the last 10 update attempts (version, date,
    success/failure) from the `update_history` config key.
  - JS: `runUpdateStage()` recursive async loop; `markStageActive/Done/Failed()`;
    `appendLog()`; rollback and abort handlers. Destructive stages (`maintenance`,
    `replace`, `migrate`, `cleanup`) offer Rollback on failure; earlier stages
    offer Abort only.

  **`include/bootstrap.php`** (extended) — three new `require_once` lines for
  `AbstractUpdateProvider`, `GitHubUpdateProvider`, and `UpdaterService` added
  after the existing step 7 service class loads. Header comment updated.

  **`include/functions.php`** (extended) — `human_time_diff(int $timestamp): string`
  added under the Formatting section. Produces strings suitable for appending
  " ago" at the call site (e.g. "3 minutes", "2 hours", "4 days",
  "less than a minute"). Used by the stuck-session notice in `admin/update.php`.

  **New config keys** (stored in `{PREFIX}config`, no migration required):

  | Key | Default | Description |
  |-----|---------|-------------|
  | `update_provider_type` | `github` | Active release provider class |
  | `update_github_repo` | `intothisshadow/Lumora` | GitHub `owner/repo` for the GitHub provider |
  | `update_preserve_themes` | `1` | Skip `themes/` during file replacement |
  | `update_preserve_plugins` | `1` | Skip `plugins/` during file replacement |
  | `update_history` | JSON array | Last 10 update attempts (newest first) |

  **Working directory layout** (all created on first use; `.htaccess` denies web
  access on Apache hosts):
  ```
  cache/.updates/
    lock.json              — active update state
    lumora-v{ver}.zip     — downloaded archive
    extract/               — extracted archive contents
    backup/
      config.php           — config.php snapshot
      database.sql         — full SQL dump of all prefixed tables
    update.log             — append-only event log
    .maintenance_active    — flag file for maintenance mode
    .htaccess              — Apache deny-all
  ```

### Changed

- **Updated Lumora Gallery website URL** (`include/services/ThemeRenderer.php`,
  `include/services/UpdateService.php`, `README.md`): Standardised all
  references to the official Lumora Gallery website to the new URL
  (`https://coding.unloved-heart.net/scripts/Lumora`). The "Powered by"
  credit link in `ThemeRenderer::renderPoweredBy()`, the repository link
  in the README Development section, and the update-check endpoint constant
  in `UpdateService` have all been updated. Completes TODO item 1.

### Fixed

- **`admin/installation.php` — Health Check button (and all JS-driven buttons on the page) did nothing** (TODO item 3): The `<script>` block contained `const STORED = {$v_stored_url};` and `urlField.value = {$v_detected_url};`, where `$v_stored_url` and `$v_detected_url` were produced by `h()` (HTML-escaping only), not `json_encode()`. Interpolating a bare URL like `https://example.com/Lumora/` without quotes into a JS expression caused the engine to parse `https:` as a statement label and `//example.com/Lumora/` as a line comment, producing a `SyntaxError` that aborted the entire `<script>` block before `DOMContentLoaded` was registered. All click-driven features on the page were completely dead: **Run Health Check**, the live URL preview, the **Copy detected URL** button, and all four **Migration Helper** "Apply to form" buttons. Fixed by adding `$stored_url_js = json_encode($stored['base_url'])` and `$detected_url_js = json_encode($env['detected_url'])` and using those safely quoted literals in the JS (`const STORED = {$stored_url_js};`, `const DETECTED_URL = {$detected_url_js};`). The two `h()`-escaped `$v_*` variables are retained for use in HTML attributes only, where they remain correct.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Coppermine Importer — In-wizard cover image assignment** (`plugins/coppermine-importer/CoppermineImporter.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/ajax_import.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/index.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/version.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/plugin.json`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/README.md`):
  Album and category cover images (`cpg_albums.thumb`, `cpg_categories.thumb`) are
  now preserved automatically as part of the main import wizard, completing TODO
  item 5. Cover assignment runs as a dedicated **Cover images** step at the end of
  the wizard — after all images have been imported and both CPG→Lumora ID maps are
  fully populated in session — then the wizard proceeds to the existing Finish step.

  **How it works:**
  - The wizard JS gains a `'covers'` phase between `'images'` and `'finish'`. A
    single `apply_covers` AJAX call is made; it is non-chunked and non-critical:
    a network error or server failure logs a warning in the import log and sets
    `cov-status` to *skipped* without blocking Finish or the results page.
  - `CoppermineImporter::importCovers(array $cat_id_map, array $album_id_map): array`
    — new public method. Reads every CPG album and category with `thumb > 0`,
    batch-fetches `(aid, filename)` for all referenced picture IDs via the existing
    `fetchCpgPictureInfo()` helper, then resolves each to a Lumora image_id via:
    `pid → (aid, filename) → album_id_map[aid] → (Lumora album_id, filename) → Lumora
    image_id`. All writes are wrapped in a single `LumoraDB` transaction; individual
    row failures are caught per-row so one bad reference never aborts the batch.
    Missing covers fall through silently to Lumora’s automatic cover selection
    (`thumb_image_id = 0`). Returns `{updated, skipped, warnings}`.
  - `case 'apply_covers':` added to `ajax_import.php`. Calls `importCovers()` with
    the full ID maps from session; logs all warnings and a summary event via
    `MigrationService::logEvent()`; catches any `\Throwable` and returns a graceful
    JSON response so the wizard can always proceed to Finish.
  - Step 3 progress UI gains a **Cover images** status row (no progress bar—single
    call). When complete it shows e.g. *42 assigned ✓*; on error it shows *skipped*
    with a log entry.
  - The `'images'` phase JS is updated: when images are done (`r.done = true`) it
    now transitions to `phase = 'covers'` instead of directly to `phase = 'finish'`.
    The stopped-import logic is updated so the Stop button still halts the import
    mid-images (`stopped && !r.done`), but once all images are complete cover
    assignment always runs regardless of the stopped flag (it is a single fast call).
  - Plugin bumped to **v1.1.0** (`version.php`, `plugin.json`).
  - **Relationship to Metadata Sync tool:** The in-wizard `importCovers()` uses the
    exact CPG→Lumora ID maps built in the current session, which is more reliable
    than the folder/name-path matching the standalone Metadata Sync tool uses. The
    sync tool remains the recommended fallback for re-running cover assignment after
    a stopped import or for galleries imported before v1.1.0.

- **Admin UI Pagination — Albums and Categories** (`admin/albums.php`,
  `admin/categories.php`, `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`,
  `include/services/GalleryService.php`):
  Both the Albums and Categories admin list pages now paginate at the database
  level so only the current page's rows are fetched, keeping large galleries
  responsive regardless of how many albums or categories exist.

  - **Page size selector** — three options (25 / 50 / 100 items per page),
    rendered as an auto-submitting `<select>` above the table. The selected
    value is persisted in `$_SESSION['lum_adm_per_page_albums']` and
    `$_SESSION['lum_adm_per_page_categories']` so it survives page navigation.
    Defaults to 25 on first visit.

  - **Item count summary** — "Showing 26–50 of 847 albums" displayed to the
    left of the per-page selector on every list page.

  - **Pagination controls** — Bootstrap 5 `<nav>` rendered above and below the
    table. Shows Previous / page-number window (±2 around the current page plus
    first and last) / Next. Ellipsis indicators are inserted for gaps.
    Pages with only one page of results show no pagination controls.

  - **State preservation** — pagination links include the current `per_page`
    value and, on the Albums page, the active `cat` category-filter parameter,
    so filter context is never lost while navigating between pages.

  - **Database-level queries** — `LIMIT / OFFSET` is applied at the SQL layer.
    The list views no longer fetch every row into PHP.

  - **`GalleryService::countAdminAlbums(int $cat_id = 0): int`** — count query
    for the admin album list, with optional category filter.

  - **`GalleryService::getAdminAlbums(int $cat_id, int $page, int $per_page): array`** —
    paginated album fetch with `cat_name` join and `image_count` subquery.

  - **`GalleryService::countAllCategories(): int`** — count query for the admin
    category list.

  - **`GalleryService::getPaginatedCategoriesFlat(int $page, int $per_page): array`** —
    paginated category fetch ordered identically to `getAllCategoriesFlat()`. The
    full flat list is still fetched once for the parent-name lookup map and for
    new/edit form dropdowns.

  - **`lum_per_page_selector(string $action, array $preserve, int $current, array $options): string`**
    in `admin_helpers.php` — renders the per-page `<form>` with optional hidden
    inputs to preserve active filter params. Submitting resets to page 1.

  - **`lum_admin_pagination(array $pag): string`** in `admin_helpers.php` —
    renders the Bootstrap 5 pagination `<nav>` from a `lumora_pagination()`
    descriptor. Returns `''` when total pages ≤ 1.

  - **`albums.php`** — `$all_cats` fetch moved inside the new/edit branch;
    it is no longer queried on list page loads.

  - Page number validation: `lumora_int()` clamps `?page=` to ≥ 1; the existing
    `lumora_pagination()` further clamps to `[1, total_pages]` so out-of-range
    page numbers never produce empty results silently.

- **Automated Database Migrations — Phase 1** (`include/services/SchemaService.php`,
  `include/migrations/AbstractMigration.php`,
  `include/migrations/Migration0001_CreateMigrationsTable.php`,
  `admin/update.php`, `admin/ajax_run_migrations.php`, `admin/dashboard.php`,
  `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`, `include/bootstrap.php`, `Lumora/migrate.php`):
  Implements the schema migration engine that automates database changes between
  Lumora releases, completing Phase 1 of the two-phase update system.
  (Phase 2, Item 12, will build the full file-download/replacement workflow on top
  of this foundation.)

  **Architecture decisions (locked in to constrain Phase 2):**
  - PHP class migrations with `up()` and `down()` methods — not raw SQL files.
  - Migration classes live in `include/migrations/` as `Migration{NNNN}_{Description}.php`.
  - Applied migrations are tracked in a dedicated `{PREFIX}migrations` table —
    not in the config table, so tracking survives config resets.
  - `SchemaService` exposes a clean library API (`runPendingMigrations()`,
    `getPendingMigrations()`) with no UI coupling so Phase 2 can call it directly.

  **`SchemaService`** (`include/services/SchemaService.php`) — new static service class
  (named `SchemaService` to avoid collision with the existing `MigrationService` class
  which tracks gallery imports from Coppermine and similar platforms):
  - `discoverMigrations()` — scans `include/migrations/` for `Migration*.php` files,
    validates names against the expected pattern, returns sorted class name list.
  - `getAppliedMigrations()` — queries `{PREFIX}migrations`; returns empty array
    gracefully when the table does not yet exist.
  - `getPendingMigrations()` — set difference of discovered vs applied; result is
    cached per request to avoid repeated DB hits (badge + dashboard both call it).
  - `hasPendingMigrations()` — convenience bool; used by nav badge and dashboard.
  - `runPendingMigrations(): array{applied: list<string>, errors: list<string>}` —
    runs all pending migrations in numeric order; stops on first failure; logs every
    result via `lumora_log()`; resets request cache after the run.
  - `rollback(string $migration): bool` — calls `down()` on a single named
    migration and removes its tracking record.
  - `getMigrationStatus(): array{applied: list<string>, pending: list<string>}` —
    returns both lists for the admin UI.
  - Class name validation before any filesystem path use prevents directory traversal.

  **`AbstractMigration`** (`include/migrations/AbstractMigration.php`) — abstract
  base class all migration classes must extend:
  - `abstract up(): void` and `abstract down(): void`.
  - `tableExists(string $table): bool`, `columnExists(string $table, string $col): bool`,
    `indexExists(string $table, string $index): bool` — INFORMATION_SCHEMA helpers
    so migrations can write safe conditional DDL without "table already exists" errors.

  **`Migration0001_CreateMigrationsTable`**
  (`include/migrations/Migration0001_CreateMigrationsTable.php`) — self-bootstrapping
  first migration. `up()` creates `{PREFIX}migrations` using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
  EXISTS`. After `up()` executes, `SchemaService::runOne()` inserts this migration's
  record into the newly-created table, completing the bootstrap loop. `down()` drops
  the table with `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`.

  **`admin/ajax_run_migrations.php`** — AJAX endpoint called from the Updates page.
  Validates CSRF and admin session, calls `SchemaService::runPendingMigrations()`,
  and returns `{success, applied[], errors[], message}` JSON.

  **`admin/update.php`** (extended) — **Database Updates** section added between the
  version status card and the Check for Updates card:
  - When schema is current: green ✓ badge + applied count.
  - When migrations are pending: amber ⚠ badge, list of pending migration class names,
    and a **🗄 Run Database Update** button. Clicking POSTs to `ajax_run_migrations.php`,
    shows the result, then reloads the page on success.
  - The existing application update check and AJAX infrastructure is unchanged.

  **`admin/dashboard.php`** (extended) — amber dismissible warning banner shown when
  `SchemaService::hasPendingMigrations()` is true; links to `admin/update.php`.

  **`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`** (extended) — the `!` badge on the **Updates**
  nav item now appears when *either* a new application version is available *or* schema
  migrations are pending (`UpdateService::hasCachedUpdate() || SchemaService::hasPendingMigrations()`).

  **`include/bootstrap.php`** (extended) — `SchemaService.php` added to the step 7
  service class load sequence.

  **`Lumora/migrate.php`** — CLI entry point (PHP CLI only; returns HTTP 403 if
  accessed via web). Supports `--dry-run`, `--status`, and
  `--rollback <ClassName>` flags; exits 0 on success, 1 on failure.

- **Unique Table Prefix Generation During Installation** (`install/index.php`, `config.sample.php`):
  The installer now generates a unique, cryptographically random table prefix for every new
  Lumora installation instead of always defaulting to `lum_`. This makes table names harder
  to guess in shared-database environments, adding a layer of defence against automated
  attacks and SQL injection attempts that rely on known table names.

  - **`ins_generate_prefix()`** — new helper function. Generates a prefix in the format
    `lum_XXXXXXXX_` where `XXXXXXXX` is 8 lowercase hexadecimal characters derived from
    `random_bytes(5)`. Example output: `lum_3f9a12b4_`. Uses only letters, digits, and
    underscores, satisfying all MariaDB/MySQL identifier rules. The fixed `lum_` lead keeps
    the prefix immediately recognisable as a Lumora installation.

  - **Session persistence** — the generated prefix is stored in `$_SESSION['ins_suggested_prefix']`
    on the first GET request and reused for the lifetime of the install session. Page refreshes
    and failed submissions always show the same generated value, preventing confusing prefix
    changes mid-flow. A forced reinstall (`?force=1`) regenerates a fresh prefix.

  - **Advanced-user override** — the prefix field remains a free-text input so advanced users
    can specify any prefix that matches `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+`. The field carries an `auto-generated`
    badge and updated help text explaining the security purpose. Browser-level pattern validation
    (`pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9_]+"`) prevents invalid characters.

  - **Step 2 confirmation card** — after successful database setup, step 2 now shows a green
    **Database Configuration Confirmed** summary card displaying the database name and the
    confirmed prefix in `<code>` with a note to record the value. The card is also shown when
    step 2 is re-rendered after a validation error (e.g. password mismatch), so the prefix is
    always visible until the install completes.

  - **Session cleanup** — `$_SESSION['ins_suggested_prefix']` is cleared alongside all other
    installer session keys when installation completes successfully.

  - **Existing installations unaffected** — all existing galleries running on `lum_` (or any
    other custom prefix) continue to work without any change. The prefix is read from
    `config.php` at runtime via `DB_PREFIX`; no application code hard-codes `lum_`. The
    full `{PREFIX}` substitution path through `LumoraDB::query()`, `schema.sql`, and all
    service classes was already in place.

  - **`config.sample.php`** — `DB_PREFIX` comment updated to document the new
    `lum_XXXXXXXX_` format and note that existing `lum_` installs are unaffected.

## [1.7.1] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Theme Metadata from CSS Headers** (`include/functions.php`, `admin/config.php`,
  `themes/default/lumora.css`, `themes/classic-fansite/fansite.css`):
  Theme display names, author, and design URI can now be declared in a
  WordPress-style CSS header comment at the top of a theme's primary stylesheet,
  instead of relying on the folder name alone.

  - **`lumora_theme_primary_stylesheet(string $theme): ?string`** — locates a
    theme's primary stylesheet by finding the first theme-relative
    (`{THEME_URL}`) stylesheet `<link>` in its `template.html`, in document
    order. For the bundled themes this resolves to `lumora.css` (default) and
    `fansite.css` (classic-fansite and its derivatives) — the base stylesheet
    linked before any optional `custom.css` override.

  - **`lumora_get_theme_meta(string $theme): array`** — reads `Theme Name`,
    `Author`, and `Design URI` from the first CSS comment block in the primary
    stylesheet. Unrecognised fields are ignored; any missing field is returned
    empty, and `name` falls back to the directory name when no header is
    present at all, so every theme always has a usable display name.

  - **`admin/config.php`** — the **Active Theme** dropdown on **Configuration
    → Appearance** now shows each theme's `Theme Name` instead of
    `ucfirst($folder)`, while the submitted `<option>` value remains the
    folder name so existing `theme` config values keep working unchanged. A
    small reference table (Theme / Folder / Author / Design URI) is rendered
    beneath the selector for every installed theme; Design URI links open in
    a new tab.

  - **Core themes updated** with a standardised metadata header
    (`Theme Name`, `Author`) at the very top of their primary stylesheet:
    `themes/default/lumora.css` ("Default") and
    `themes/classic-fansite/fansite.css` ("Classic Fansite"). Both existing
    decorative file-header comments are preserved unchanged immediately below
    the new metadata block.

- **Admin Password Recovery** (`admin/forgot_password.php`, `admin/reset_password.php`,
  `include/auth.php`, `admin/login.php`, `install/schema.sql`, `version.php`):
  Admins who have lost their password can now generate a secure reset link without
  needing SMTP configured. The feature targets self-hosted installations where email
  delivery is not guaranteed.

  **Flow:**
  1. Admin clicks **Forgot password?** on the login page.
  2. `admin/forgot_password.php` generates a single-use, 1-hour split-token reset URL
     and writes it to `lumora_recovery.txt` in the gallery root — recoverable at any
     time via FTP or a hosting file manager.
  3. If an email address is set on the admin account, a best-effort send via PHP's
     `mail()` function is attempted in addition to the file.
  4. Admin opens the URL from the file, sets a new password on
     `admin/reset_password.php`, and the token is immediately consumed.
  5. `lumora_recovery.txt` is deleted automatically after a successful reset.

  **Security design:**
  - Split-token scheme identical to the remember-me implementation: `selector`
    (32-char hex) stored plain for lookup; `SHA-256(validator)` stored in DB;
    full validator travels only in the reset URL.
  - Tokens expire after 1 hour; only one active reset token per user at a time
    (existing tokens are revoked before a new one is issued).
  - Tokens are single-use — consumed and deleted immediately on successful
    password change.
  - All remember-me tokens for the user are also revoked after a successful reset,
    forcing a fresh login.
  - `forgot_password.php` shows an identical success message whether or not an
    admin account was found, to avoid disclosing account existence.
  - `mail()` warnings are captured via a temporary error handler and routed to
    the PHP error log only — never exposed to the browser.

  **New DB table** `{PREFIX}password_reset_tokens` (DB version 7):

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `lum_password_reset_tokens` (
    `id`               bigint UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `user_id`          int UNSIGNED    NOT NULL,
    `selector`         varchar(32)     NOT NULL,
    `hashed_validator` varchar(64)     NOT NULL,
    `expires_at`       datetime        NOT NULL,
    `created_at`       datetime        NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    UNIQUE KEY `selector`  (`selector`),
    KEY `user_id`          (`user_id`),
    KEY `expires_at`       (`expires_at`)
  ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
  ```
  Replace `lum_` with your actual table prefix. Fresh installations from
  `install/schema.sql` receive the table automatically.

  **New auth functions** in `include/auth.php`:
  - `lumora_create_reset_token(int $user_id): array` — generates and stores a
    split-token, returns `['selector', 'validator', 'expires_at']`; throws on DB
    error (table absent) so the caller can show a migration hint.
  - `lumora_verify_reset_token(string $selector, string $validator): ?int` —
    validates format, expiry, and hashed validator; returns the user_id on success
    or null on any failure; prunes expired tokens in place.
  - `lumora_consume_reset_token(string $selector): void` — deletes one token by
    selector after successful password change.
  - `lumora_clear_reset_tokens(int $user_id): void` — deletes all reset tokens for
    a user; fails silently on pre-v7 installs.

  **`admin/login.php`** — **Forgot password?** link added below the login form.

  **`version.php`** — `LUMORA_DB_VERSION` bumped from 6 to 7.

- **Regenerate Missing Thumbnails** (`admin/ajax_missing_thumbs.php`, `admin/tools.php`):
  New Tool 4 on **Admin → Tools** that scans all images in scope (entire gallery
  or a selected album) and regenerates thumbnails **only** for images where the
  thumbnail file is missing or empty, leaving existing valid thumbnails untouched.

  This complements the existing “Regenerate All Thumbnails” tool (Tool 3), which
  unconditionally overwrites every thumbnail. Tool 4 is significantly faster when
  only a small fraction of thumbnails are absent (e.g. after adding images manually
  or after a partial batch-add failure).

  - **`admin/ajax_missing_thumbs.php`** — new AJAX chunk handler. Uses the same
    keyset-paginated architecture (`WHERE id > last_id`) and the same
    `lumora_generate_thumb()` / `LUMORA_THUMB_PREFIX` pipeline as the existing
    handlers. Before generating, it checks `is_file($thumb_path)` and
    `filesize($thumb_path) > 0`; images whose thumbnail already passes both
    checks are counted as `skipped` without any disk I/O or CPU work. Images
    whose original file is absent are counted as `no_orig`. JSON response shape:
    `{ checked, regenerated, skipped, no_orig, last_id, errors[], done }`.

  - **`admin/tools.php`** — Tool 4 card and progress UI added. The button is
    styled `btn-outline-success` (distinct from Tool 3’s `btn-primary`) and
    carries the same `disabled` attribute as Tool 3 when no image processor is
    available. Progress bar uses `bg-warning`. Completion summary shows either
    “All N thumbnails are already present” or “X missing thumbnails regenerated,
    Y already existed”. The existing three tools are unchanged.

- **Admin Image Search** (`admin/images.php`, `include/services/GalleryService.php`,
  `install/schema.sql`):
  Administrators can now search images by filename or title directly from
  **Admin → Images**, either within a selected album or across the entire gallery.

  - **Search bar** integrated into the album selector card. A single `?search=term`
    GET parameter controls the active query; the album scope (`?album=N`) is
    preserved when submitting a search and vice versa. A **✕ Clear** button
    removes the active query and returns to the current album view.

  - **Scoped vs. cross-album search:** when an album is selected and a search
    term is entered the query is limited to that album's rows (uses the existing
    `album_approved` index, fast even at 500 K images). When no album is selected
    the search runs across all albums — results show the category › album path
    below each filename so images are identifiable without opening their album.

  - **Result header** shows `Results for "term" in Album Title (N images)` or
    `Results for "term" across all albums (N images)`. The column header reads
    `Title / Filename / Album` in cross-album mode.

  - **Pagination, bulk delete, bulk move, single-image edit/delete** all
    preserve the active search term. After a save or delete the admin is
    returned to the same search results page. `location.reload()` in the bulk
    AJAX handlers preserves the search via the URL automatically.

  - **Empty-state message** when no images match, with a **Clear search** link.

  - **`GalleryService::searchImages(string $query, int $album_id, int $page,
    int $per_page): array`** — paginated image search using prepared `LIKE`
    statements against `filename` and `title`. Joins `albums` and `categories`
    so results include `album_title` and `cat_name`.

  - **`GalleryService::countSearchImages(string $query, int $album_id): int`** —
    companion count method for pagination.

  - **`install/schema.sql`** — two B-tree prefix indexes added to `{PREFIX}images`
    (`filename(191)`, `title(191)`). These improve album-scoped search performance
    in combination with the existing `album_approved` index. For very large
    galleries (500 K+) a `FULLTEXT KEY search_text (filename, title)` can be
    added manually; see the inline comment in `schema.sql` for the ALTER TABLE
    statement and the corresponding switch needed in `GalleryService::searchImages`.

  **Migration for existing installations** (optional, performance only — no
  functional change):
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE `lum_images`
    ADD KEY `filename` (`filename`(191)),
    ADD KEY `title`    (`title`(191));
  ```
  Replace `lum_` with your actual table prefix.
  
  
  
- **Coppermine Importer — Metadata Sync tool** (`plugins/coppermine-importer/CoppermineImporter.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/sync_metadata.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/index.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/version.php`,
  `plugins/coppermine-importer/README.md`):
  Standalone companion to the main import wizard that syncs category and album
  cover-thumbnail selections from an existing Coppermine installation into an
  already-imported Lumora gallery, without requiring a full re-import.

  The main wizard does not carry over cover selections because it processes records
  in small keyset-paginated chunks and does not persist the CPG-ID → Lumora-ID
  map between requests. The sync tool re-derives matches from durable on-disk
  identifiers: albums by folder path (from `cpg_pictures.filepath`, falling back
  to `cpg_albums.keyword`), categories by full name-path from root using ASCII
  0x1F as a separator so names containing slashes cannot collide.

  - **`CoppermineImporter::previewThumbnailSync(): array`** — read-only method;
    returns a `{categories: [...], albums: [...]}` structure with per-record status
    strings (`ready`, `already_set`, `unmatched`, `image_unresolved`, `ambiguous`).

  - **`CoppermineImporter::applyThumbnailSync(bool $overwrite): array`** —
    re-runs the same matching logic fresh (no client state trusted), applies writes
    inside a single `LumoraDB` transaction with rollback on any `\Throwable`, and
    returns `{updated, skipped, errors}`.

  - **Private helpers added to `CoppermineImporter`:** `matchAlbumThumbnails()`,
    `matchCategoryThumbnails()`, `buildCpgCategoryPath()`,
    `buildLumoraCategoryPath()`, `resolvePidToLumoraImage()`,
    `fetchCpgPictureInfo()`, `fetchAllCpgAlbumFolders()`,
    `fetchLumoraAlbumsByFolder()`.

  - **`admin/sync_metadata.php`** — new three-step admin page (Credentials →
    Preview → Report). Separate session key (`lumora_cpg_thumb_sync`) prevents
    collision with the main wizard. Preview step shows a tally table and a
    scrollable per-record detail table with status badges. Apply step requires a
    backup-confirmation checkbox; writes a timestamped audit log to
    `plugins/coppermine-importer/logs/`. Report step shows matched/updated/skipped
    counts, errors (first 20 listed), and the log file path.

  - **`admin/index.php` (wizard)** — two contextual links to `sync_metadata.php`
    added: a blue info notice on the credentials page (shown only after a previous
    import), and a small-text paragraph on the results page.

  - **`version.php`** — new constant `LUMORA_CPG_IMPORTER_SYNC_SOURCE`
    (`'coppermine_thumb_sync'`): the source key used in `migration_log` for sync
    runs, kept separate from `LUMORA_CPG_IMPORTER_SOURCE` so sync events never
    mix with or overwrite the main import's `migration_status` row.

  - **`README.md`** — new § *Metadata Sync tool* section documenting the sync
    scope table, matching strategy, preview status values, and safety guarantees.

### Fixed

- **Albums and thumbnails missing their added/updated date — regression from a prior fix lost on a file overwrite** (`include/services/ThemeRenderer.php`, `themes/default/lumora.css`, `themes/classic-fansite/fansite.css`):
  `TODO.md` flagged that both the album info display and the thumbnail info display
  were missing their added/updated date, noting the date display had "already once
  been fixed" (recorded as completed in `docs/HISTORY.md` under the v1.7.0 Bug Fixes
  section). The date-rendering code was absent from the current `ThemeRenderer.php`
  and no `.lum-card-date` / `.lum-thumb-date` CSS existed in either core theme,
  confirming the fix was lost when the file was overwritten with a pre-fix version —
  the same class of regression already documented for `install/index.php` in the
  1.7.0 changelog entry. Re-implemented:
  - `ThemeRenderer::renderCatgrid()` (album branch) now appends a `.lum-card-date`
    span reading "Added {j M Y}", derived from the album's existing `created_at`
    column, alongside the existing image-count and view-count spans.
  - `ThemeRenderer::renderThumbgrid()` now appends a `.lum-thumb-date` span to each
    thumbnail's `<figcaption>`, derived from the image's existing `added_at` column.
    The span is full-width (`flex: 1 0 100%`) so it wraps onto its own centred row
    below the resolution/views row rather than competing for horizontal space.
  - Both bundled core themes (`default`, `classic-fansite`) receive matching
    `.lum-card-date` (tinted row, consistent with the existing `.lum-card-images` /
    `.lum-card-views` pattern) and `.lum-thumb-date` (centred caption row with a
    📅 icon, consistent with the existing `.lum-views` 👁 icon) rules. No database
    migration or service-layer change was required — `created_at` and `added_at`
    were already selected by `GalleryService::getAlbums()`/`getAlbum()` and every
    image-fetching method respectively.

- **Sort bar overflowed past the viewport edge on narrow phones** (`themes/default/lumora.css`,
  `themes/classic-fansite/fansite.css`):
  `ThemeRenderer::renderSortControls()` renders the five sort options (Default,
  Newest, Oldest, Most Viewed, Filename) inside a single Bootstrap `.btn-group`,
  which by design is a non-wrapping flex item with joined-button negative margins.
  On phones narrower than ~575px the group has no room to fit all five buttons and
  overflows past the right edge of the viewport instead of wrapping, confirmed on
  the `aknightofthesevenkindoms` theme (a `classic-fansite` derivative) and present
  identically in both bundled core themes. Fixed by adding a `@media (max-width:
  575px)` rule to each theme's existing mobile breakpoint block that forces
  `.lum-sort-bar .btn-group` to `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap`, sizes each `.btn`
  with `flex: 1 1 auto`, and resets the joined-row-only negative `margin-left` and
  squared-off corners (`border-radius` restored per-button) so wrapped rows render
  cleanly. `default/lumora.css` uses `var(--lum-card-radius)`; `classic-fansite/fansite.css`
  uses `var(--fs-radius)`, consistent with each theme's existing variable scheme.

- **Category list header labels overflowed past the viewport edge on narrow phones**
  (`themes/default/lumora.css`, `themes/classic-fansite/fansite.css`):
  The existing `@media (max-width: 575px)` rule shrinks the `.lum-catlist-col-albums`
  and `.lum-catlist-col-images` *data* cells to a 56px column width, but never touched
  the matching `.lum-catlist-header-cell--albums` / `--images` *header* labels
  ("ALBUMS" / "IMAGES"), which kept the full `.75rem` font-size, `.75rem` padding, and
  `.05em` letter-spacing — far too wide for a 56px column, so "IMAGES" ran past the
  card and viewport edge (confirmed on the `aknightofthesevenkindoms` theme, a
  `classic-fansite` derivative, and present identically in both core themes). Fixed by
  shrinking the header cells to `.6rem` font-size, `.15rem` horizontal padding, and
  zero letter-spacing within the same mobile breakpoint, matching the row cells.

- corrected the official Lumora Gallery website URL in `ThemeRenderer.php`

- **Album cards showed the Lumora import date instead of when content was actually last added** (`include/services/GalleryService.php`, `include/services/ThemeRenderer.php`):
  Follow-up to the date-display fix above. The album card's date span (added in that
  fix) read `albums.created_at` — the timestamp the album row was inserted/imported,
  set once and never updated again — so albums that received new images long after
  import (e.g. via the Coppermine importer) kept showing the original import date
  under the label "Added", even though `images.added_at` was correct for every
  individual image. `GalleryService::getLatestUpdatedAlbums()` already computed the
  correct value (`MAX(images.added_at)` as `latest_added_at`) for the home page's
  "Recently Updated" section, but `ThemeRenderer::renderCatgrid()` ignored that field
  and used `created_at` regardless of which query supplied the row. Fixed:
  - `GalleryService::getAlbums()` now also selects `latest_added_at` via the same
    `MAX(i2.added_at)` subquery already used by `getLatestUpdatedAlbums()`, so
    category-page album listings carry the same field.
  - `ThemeRenderer::renderCatgrid()` (album branch) now prefers `latest_added_at`
    over `created_at` for the date span, falling back to `created_at` only for
    albums with no approved images yet, and relabels the span from "Added" to
    "Updated" to reflect what the date now represents. No CSS or schema change
    required — `.lum-card-date` styling and the `created_at` column are unchanged.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Update Checker — Phase 1** (`include/services/UpdateService.php`, `admin/update.php`,
  `admin/ajax_update_check.php`, `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`, `admin/dashboard.php`,
  `include/bootstrap.php`):
  Lumora can now check for newer releases against a JSON endpoint hosted on the Lumora
  website (`https://coding.unloved-heart.net/lumora/update.json`). No gallery content, user
  data, or identifying information is transmitted — only a plain GET request is made.

  - **`UpdateService`** (`include/services/UpdateService.php`) — new static service class.
    Fetches the remote endpoint, caches the result in the config table for 24 hours, and
    exposes `check(bool $force)` for a full status check, `getCachedStatus()` for a
    cache-only read (used in the nav and dashboard to avoid any I/O on every page load),
    `hasCachedUpdate(): bool` for the nav badge, and `isCacheExpired(): bool` so the
    Updates page can auto-trigger an AJAX refresh when the cache is stale.
    `version_compare()` is used for semantic version comparison.
    Network failures fall back to the stale cache so admins always see the last known
    state rather than a blank error. A temporary `set_error_handler` / `restore_error_handler`
    pair suppresses the E_WARNING that `file_get_contents()` emits on TCP failure without
    using the `@` operator.

  - **`admin/update.php`** — new admin page showing installed version, current status
    (up to date / update available / error / not checked), last-checked timestamp,
    changelog and download links when an update is available, a PHP-version compatibility
    warning when the new release requires a higher PHP version, and a **Check for Updates
    Now** button. The page renders from cache only (no PHP-level HTTP call); if the cache
    is expired, JS auto-triggers an AJAX check after DOM load to avoid server-side
    blocking.

  - **`admin/ajax_update_check.php`** — AJAX endpoint that calls
    `UpdateService::check(force: true)` and returns the full status array as JSON.
    Validates CSRF and admin authentication.

  - **`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`** — **Updates** (🔔) nav item added between
    Import and Account. A red `!` badge appears next to the label whenever the cached
    status shows an update is available (no HTTP call — reads config cache only).

  - **`admin/dashboard.php`** — dismissible info-bar shown at the top of the dashboard
    when the cached status indicates an update is available. Includes inline changelog
    and download links plus a **Details** link to `update.php`. No HTTP call is made
    at dashboard render time.

  - **`include/bootstrap.php`** — `UpdateService.php` loaded in step 7 alongside the
    other service classes.

  **Update endpoint format** — the JSON file hosted at the Lumora website must follow
  this shape (all fields optional except `latest_version`):
  ```json
  {
    "latest_version": "1.6.0",
    "minimum_php":    "8.2",
    "release_date":   "2026-06-15",
    "download_url":   "https://github.com/{owner}/lumora/releases/download/v1.6.0/lumora-v1.6.0.zip",
    "changelog_url":  "https://coding.unloved-heart.net/lumora/changelog"
  }
  ```
  Additional fields may be added in future without breaking existing installations.

### Fixed

- **`install/schema.sql` — semicolon in `COMMENT` string made the schema permanently fragile**:
  The `thumb_image_id` column on `{PREFIX}categories` carried
  `COMMENT 'FK to images.id; 0 = auto-pick first album image'`. The semicolon
  inside the string literal is invisible to any string-literal-aware SQL splitter
  but is a latent footgun: if the `ins_split_sql()` guard is ever lost (e.g. the
  file is replaced with a pre-fix version), the naive `explode(';', ...)` path
  silently re-emerges and the installer breaks again. Fixed by changing the
  semicolon to a comma: `'FK to images.id, 0 = auto-pick first album image'`.
  The migration comment at the top of the file is updated to match.

- **`install/index.php` — `ins_split_sql()` lost when file was overwritten**:
  The string-literal-aware SQL splitter added to fix the `COMMENT` semicolon bug
  was absent from the file on disk — the file had been replaced with a pre-fix
  version. `ins_run_schema()` had reverted to the naive `explode(';', $sql_clean)`
  path, causing the same SQLSTATE[42000] error 1064 on fresh installs.
  `ins_split_sql()` re-added and `ins_run_schema()` updated to call it.

### Changed

- **`renderCatgrid()` — album / category card info restructured as individual rows**
  (`include/services/ThemeRenderer.php`, `themes/*/fansite.css`,
  `themes/default/lumora.css`):
  Album and category cards previously showed a single `<small class="text-muted">`
  string joining all info with ` — ` (e.g. "2,704 images — 527 views"). Each piece
  of info is now its own `<span>` inside a `.lum-card-meta` wrapper div, enabling
  themes to colour, center, and space each stat independently.
  - Albums emit `.lum-card-images` and `.lum-card-views` spans.
  - Categories emit `.lum-card-subcats` and/or `.lum-card-albums` spans.
  - All three bundled themes receive `.lum-card-meta` CSS: the default theme uses a
    light blue / neutral-gray pair; `classic-fansite` uses a light purple-tint /
    body-background pair; the GoT `aknightofthesevenkindoms` theme uses the
    Coppermine-matched teal / warm-beige pair shared with the thumbnail caption rows.

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Coppermine Importer — Stop Import button** (`plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/index.php`):
  Step 3 (Import Progress) now shows a ⏹ **Stop Import** button below the log
  panel. Clicking it sets a client-side `stopped` flag; the current in-flight
  AJAX batch is allowed to complete normally, then the loop halts instead of
  scheduling the next chunk. The button disables itself with a “Stopping after
  current batch…” label so the user knows the stop is pending. When the loop
  actually halts, the result panel shows a warning explaining that partial data
  was written and linking to the relevant admin pages for cleanup. The stop
  controls are hidden automatically on both clean completion and on error.

### Fixed

- **Album cards missing view count** (`include/services/ThemeRenderer.php`):
  Album cards rendered by `renderCatgrid()` displayed the image count but omitted
  the album view count. The `hits` column was already present in every album row
  (from `SELECT a.*` in `GalleryService::getAlbums()` and
  `getLatestUpdatedAlbums()`), so the fix is purely in the renderer: after
  computing the image-count string, two lines now derive `$views_str` from
  `$item['hits']` and append it with an em-dash separator, e.g.
  "42 images — 1,204 views". This affects all surfaces that call
  `renderCatgrid()` with `'album'`: the home-page "Recently Updated" strip,
  category album listings, and any future callers.

- **Coppermine Importer — album folder names used `cpg_albums.keyword` instead of actual on-disk path** (`CoppermineImporter.php`):
  `importAlbums()` derived each Lumora album folder name from the `keyword`
  column of `cpg_albums`, which may be empty or differ from the physical
  directory layout — especially on CPG installations where albums were created
  without an explicit keyword or were moved on disk. The correct source of
  truth is `cpg_pictures.filepath`, which CPG writes to every image row and
  which always reflects the actual folder path used on disk (e.g.
  `Season1/Screencaps/1x01-TheHedgeKnight`), preserving arbitrarily deep
  sub-directory trees. Fixed by adding `fetchCpgAlbumFilepaths()`, which runs
  one `SELECT aid, MIN(filepath) … GROUP BY aid` against `cpg_pictures` for
  every album chunk. The result is used as the primary folder source; albums
  with no images yet fall back to the previous `keyword`-based logic via
  `resolveCpgAlbumFolder()`. The method wraps its query in try-catch so
  installations without a `filepath` column degrade gracefully.

- **`plugins/coppermine-importer/CoppermineImporter.php` — image import failed with "Unknown column" on CPG installations with non-standard or incomplete schemas**:
  CPG databases upgraded in-place over many years often differ from the canonical
  schema, even when the application version is recent (confirmed on CPG 1.6.29).
  Two classes of column name variation were found and handled:
  - **`pwidth`/`pheight` instead of `width`/`height`**: this CPG 1.6.29 install
    stores image dimensions under `pwidth` and `pheight`.
  - **`ctime` instead of `added`**: creation timestamp stored as `ctime` rather
    than the standard `added` column name.
  - **`width`/`height`/`pos`/`caption` entirely absent**: columns added in later
    CPG versions that may simply not exist after an incomplete upgrade.
    `importImages()` previously built a fixed SELECT; any missing or renamed column
    caused `PDO::prepare()` to throw `PDOException[42S22]` immediately. Fixed by
    adding `getPictureColumns()` (queries `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` once per
    request, cached on the instance) and building the SELECT dynamically. Renamed
    columns are aliased with SQL `AS` so the foreach always reads `$row['width']`,
    `$row['height']`, and `$row['added']` regardless of the actual column name;
    entirely absent columns fall back to `0` / `''` via the existing `?? 0` / `??''`
    expressions already in the foreach.

- **`plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/ajax_import.php` + `CoppermineImporter.php` — albums skipped, images HTTP 500 during first production import**:
  Three bugs manifested together:
  1. **`array_merge()` destroys integer keys** (`ajax_import.php`): The session
     `cat_id_map` and `album_id_map` were merged using `array_merge()`, which
     re-indexes integer keys. `array_merge([1=>X, 2=>Y], [3=>Z])` produces
     `[0=>X, 1=>Y, 2=>Z]` instead of `[1=>X, 2=>Y, 3=>Z]`. As a result, album
     lookups by CPG category cid all hit the wrong Lumora category (off by one),
     and any lookup for the highest cid returned null (skipped). Fixed by using
     the `+` operator, which preserves integer keys.
  2. **`filepath` column selected but never used** (`CoppermineImporter.php`):
     `importImages()` included `filepath` in its `SELECT` from `cpg_pictures`,
     but `$row['filepath']` is never referenced anywhere in the foreach loop —
     the album folder is resolved through `$folder_map` instead. If the CPG
     installation does not have a `filepath` column on the pictures table (some
     versions differ), `PDO::prepare()` throws an uncaught `PDOException`,
     producing a blank HTTP 500 with no body. Fixed by removing `filepath` from
     the SELECT.
  3. **No try-catch around importer calls** (`ajax_import.php`): Any uncaught
     exception from an importer method produced a raw HTTP 500 with an empty
     body, showing only "HTTP 500:" in the progress UI with no diagnostic
     message. Fixed by wrapping the entire action switch in `try { … }
     catch (\Throwable $e) { cpg_json_error(…) }` so errors are always
     surfaced as readable JSON.

- **`install/index.php` — schema setup failed on first installation**:
  `ins_run_schema()` split the schema SQL on bare semicolons using `explode(';', ...)`,
  which broke when encountering the semicolon inside the column comment
  `COMMENT 'FK to images.id; 0 = auto-pick first album image'` in the `categories`
  table. MariaDB received a truncated, syntactically invalid statement and returned
  error 1064. Fixed by replacing the naive splitter with a new `ins_split_sql()`
  helper that walks the SQL character-by-character as a state machine, tracking
  single-quoted strings, double-quoted strings, and backtick-quoted identifiers so
  that semicolons inside string literals are never treated as statement delimiters.

- **`plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/index.php` — "Start Import" redirected to migration hub instead of starting the import**:
  The step-2 Cancel button was rendered as a `<form>` nested inside the Start Import
  `<form>`. Browsers discard nested `<form>` tags but keep their child elements,
  so both `<input type="hidden" name="action">` fields (values `start_import` and
  `cancel`) ended up in the same outer form. PHP's `$_POST` retains the last
  occurrence of a duplicate key, so every click of "Start Import" actually posted
  `action=cancel`, clearing the session and redirecting to `admin/migrate.php`.
  The `{$reimport_check}` block (re-import confirmation checkbox) was also placed
  outside the form, meaning it would never be submitted. Fixed by moving the
  checkbox inside the Start Import form and separating the Cancel action into a
  sibling `<form id="cpg-cancel-form">` whose empty body does not affect layout;
  the Cancel button uses the HTML5 `form="cpg-cancel-form"` attribute to submit
  that form instead.

- **`plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/index.php` — blank page on first visit**:
  Two bugs caused a blank page when loading the plugin for the first time.
  1. **PHP heredoc parse error** (step-3 block): `{$n_cat.replace(',','')}` in a
     heredoc is invalid PHP variable interpolation — `.replace()` is a JavaScript
     method, not a PHP operator. PHP parses the entire file before executing any
     code, so the syntax error in the (unreachable on step 1) case-3 block killed
     the page for all steps. Fixed by pre-computing raw integer variables
     (`$n_cat_int`, `$n_alb_int`, `$n_img_int`) in PHP and interpolating those
     directly into the `var TOTAL = {...}` JavaScript literal.
  2. **Undefined function `lumora_csrf_check()`** (`ajax_import.php`): The CSRF
     helper in `include/auth.php` is `lumora_csrf_validate()` (which exits with
     plain text on failure), not `lumora_csrf_check()`. The AJAX handler needs to
     return JSON on CSRF failure, so the call is replaced with an inline boolean
     check using `hash_equals(lumora_csrf_token(), $_POST['csrf_token'])` followed
     by `cpg_json_error(..., 403)`.

### Added

- **Coppermine Importer plugin** (`plugins/coppermine-importer/`):
  Official migration plugin for importing Coppermine Gallery (CPG 1.4–1.6)
  categories, albums, and image metadata into Lumora. Image files are not moved;
  the importer is metadata-first and preserves the existing Coppermine
  `albums/` folder structure in place.

  - **`plugins/coppermine-importer/version.php`** — single source of truth for
    the plugin version (`LUMORA_CPG_IMPORTER_VERSION = '1.0.0'`).
    All other files reference this constant; updating the version requires
    changing only `version.php` and `plugin.json`.

  - **`plugins/coppermine-importer/plugin.json`** — plugin manifest consumed by
    the Lumora migration hub (`admin/migrate.php`) for discovery, display, and
    compatibility checking against `LUMORA_VERSION`.

  - **`plugins/coppermine-importer/CoppermineImporter.php`** — core importer
    class. Opens a separate PDO connection to the Coppermine database and exposes
    three chunked import methods:
    - `importCategories(int $last_id, int $limit, array $cat_id_map): array` —
      keyset-paginated category import; builds a CPG `cid` → Lumora `cat_id` map
      used to resolve parent/child relationships.
    - `importAlbums(int $last_id, int $limit, array $cat_id_map): array` —
      keyset-paginated album import; resolves Coppermine folder paths
      (`keyword` field or zero-padded `aid`) to Lumora `folder` values;
      deduplicates folder names automatically.
    - `importImages(int $last_id, int $limit, array $album_id_map): array` —
      keyset-paginated image import; verifies file and thumbnail presence at
      `LUMORA_ALBUMS_PATH/{folder}/{filename}` and reports missing files without
      blocking the DB record from being created (reconcile later with File
      Integrity Check).
    - `validate(): array` — tests the Coppermine DB connection and returns
      record counts before the import begins.
    - HTML-entity decoding via `html_entity_decode()` for CPG-encoded title and
      description fields; `approved` normalised from ENUM('YES'/'NO') or
      tinyint; `added` normalised from datetime or Unix timestamp int.

  - **`plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/index.php`** — four-step admin wizard
    (Credentials → Preview → Import → Done). Integrates with Lumora's admin
    panel via `lum_admin_page()` and `lumora_require_admin()`. Stores CPG
    credentials and accumulated ID maps in `$_SESSION['lumora_cpg_import']`;
    session is cleared on completion or timeout (2 h). Re-import warning with
    mandatory confirmation checkbox displayed when a prior migration record exists.

  - **`plugins/coppermine-importer/admin/ajax_import.php`** — AJAX chunk
    processor. Three actions (`import_categories`, `import_albums`,
    `import_images`) process one keyset-paginated chunk per call; a `finish`
    action writes the final `migration_status` record and clears the session.
    Each call validates CSRF and admin authentication; session timeout is enforced
    server-side (2 h). Returns JSON with per-chunk counts, errors, and a
    `done` boolean.

  - **`plugins/coppermine-importer/README.md`** — documentation covering what
    is and is not imported, file-migration workflow, folder-name mapping table,
    re-import protection behaviour, DB migration SQL for v5 → v6, and
    instructions for creating future importers.

- **Migration framework** (Lumora core):

  - **`include/services/MigrationService.php`** — new static service class.
    Provides import status tracking (`getMigrationStatus`, `saveMigrationStatus`,
    `clearMigrationStatus`, `isImported`, `getAllStatuses`), migration event
    logging (`logEvent`, `getLogs`, `clearLogs`), plugin discovery
    (`discoverImporters` — scans `LUMORA_PLUGINS_PATH/*/plugin.json` for
    `"type": "importer"` entries), and semantic version compatibility checking
    (`isCompatible`). All DB calls degrade silently on pre-v6 installs.

  - **`admin/migrate.php`** — new admin hub page. Discovers installed importer
    plugins, shows each as a card with name, description, version, compatibility
    badge, previous migration status (if any), and a **Run Importer** button.
    Displays a migration history table when any sources have been imported.
    Active nav key `'migrate'` highlights the **Import** sidebar item.

  - **`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`** — **Import** (📥) nav entry added
    between Tools and Account, linking to `admin/migrate.php`.

  - **`include/bootstrap.php`** — `LUMORA_PLUGINS_PATH` constant defined (step 2);
    `MigrationService.php` loaded (step 7).

  - **`install/schema.sql`** (DB version 6) — two new tables:
    - `{PREFIX}migration_status` — one row per source platform; records
      `source`, `imported_at`, `categories`, `albums`, `images`,
      `plugin_version`. `PRIMARY KEY (source)` with `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`
      for idempotent upserts.
    - `{PREFIX}migration_log` — append-only event log written during import;
      `level` is `'info' | 'warning' | 'error'`; keyed on `(source, level)`
      and `(source, created_at)` for efficient filtering.

  - **`version.php`** — `LUMORA_DB_VERSION` bumped from 5 to 6.

### Database migration (DB v5 → v6)

Run the following SQL on existing installations (replace `lum_` with your
actual table prefix):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `lum_migration_status` (
  `source`         varchar(64)  NOT NULL,
  `imported_at`    datetime     NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `categories`     int UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  `albums`         int UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  `images`         int UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  `plugin_version` varchar(32)  NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  PRIMARY KEY (`source`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `lum_migration_log` (
  `id`         bigint UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `source`     varchar(64)     NOT NULL,
  `level`      varchar(16)     NOT NULL DEFAULT 'info',
  `message`    text            NOT NULL,
  `created_at` datetime        NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `source_level`   (`source`, `level`),
  KEY `source_created` (`source`, `created_at`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Fresh installations from `install/schema.sql` receive both tables automatically.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-15

### Security

- **Replace GET-based CSRF token on config export** (`admin/config.php`):
  The export download previously embedded the CSRF token in the URL as a query
  parameter (`?export=1&csrf_token=...`), which risks leaking the token via the
  `Referer` header and exposes it in browser history and server logs. Replaced the
  anchor link with a minimal POST form (`action="export"`); the token travels in the
  request body only and validation is handled by the existing `lumora_csrf_validate()`
  call at the top of the POST block.

### Changed

- **Migrate business logic from **free functions to service classes****
  (`include/services/LumoraConfig.php`, `include/services/GalleryService.php`,
  `include/services/ThumbnailService.php`, `include/services/ThemeRenderer.php`,
  `include/bootstrap.php`, `include/functions.php`, `include/template.php`,
  `include/thumb.php`):
  Introduces four focused static service classes in `include/services/`, resolving
  the V1 technical-debt item that flagged free functions and a global config variable
  as architectural weaknesses.

  - **`LumoraConfig`** — replaces the module-level `$LUMORA_CONFIG` global with a
    static private cache. `load()`, `get()`, and `set()` are the sole access points.
    Eliminates the `global $LUMORA_CONFIG` pattern from every call site inside the
    service layer.

  - **`GalleryService`** — collects all category, album, image, stats, and
    visitor-tracking queries that were previously scattered as free functions in
    `include/functions.php`. Method naming follows camelCase convention:
    `getCategories()`, `getAlbum()`, `getAlbumImages()`, `getGalleryStats()`,
    `trackVisitor()`, `getOnlineStats()`, etc.

  - **`ThumbnailService`** — collects all thumbnail generation, original-image
    resizing, metadata reading, extension validation, folder scanning, and
    batch-add logic from `include/thumb.php`. The Imagick and GD engines become
    `private static` methods; only `generateThumb()` is part of the public API.

  - **`ThemeRenderer`** — collects all HTML-generation functions from
    `include/template.php`, including `renderPage()`, `renderThumbgrid()`,
    `renderCatgrid()`, `renderCatlist()`, `renderBreadcrumb()`, `renderStats()`,
    `renderWhoIsOnline()`, `renderLightboxJs()`, and related helpers.
    `loadCustomFile()` becomes `private static` since it is an internal detail of
    the header/footer loading path.

  **Transition strategy — full backward compatibility preserved:** The original
  `include/functions.php`, `include/template.php`, and `include/thumb.php` are
  retained as thin forwarding-wrapper files. Every existing free function is kept
  as a one-liner that delegates to the corresponding service method. No caller
  (public pages, admin pages, AJAX handlers, or the installer) required any change.
  New V2 code can call the service classes directly.

  **Bootstrap load order updated** (`include/bootstrap.php`): the four service
  class files are now required immediately after `db.php` (step 7), before the
  legacy include files (steps 8–11). PHP class definitions are parsed at require
  time; no service method is invoked before all includes are loaded, so
  forward-references to free functions defined later are safe.

  **Utility free functions retained as-is** in `include/functions.php`: `h()`,
  `lumora_redirect()`, `lumora_int()`, `lumora_base_url()`, `lumora_album_path()`,
  `lumora_album_url()`, `lumora_active_theme()`, `lumora_theme_url()`,
  `lumora_theme_path()`, `lumora_list_themes()`, `lumora_format_bytes()`,
  `lumora_generate_folder()`, `lumora_sanitize_folder()`, `image_original_url()`,
  `image_thumb_url()`, `image_original_path()`, `image_thumb_path()`,
  `lumora_pagination()`, and `lumora_log()` have no class-level benefit and remain
  as global utility functions.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **"Powered by" credit invisible on dark-footer themes** (`include/template.php`,
  `themes/default/lumora.css`): `lumora_render_powered_by()` was wrapping the credit
  in `<small class="text-muted">`. Bootstrap 5's `.text-muted` applies
  `color: #6c757d !important`, overriding any inherited footer colour. In the
  classic-fansite theme the footer background is dark purple (`#2a1040`), making
  the gray text invisible. Fixed by removing the `text-muted` class from the
  generated HTML so the credit inherits its colour from the theme's footer rule.
  Added an explicit `color: #6c757d` to `.lum-footer` in `lumora.css` so the
  default theme's visual appearance is unchanged.

### Added

- **Category list layout** (`include/template.php`, `include/functions.php`, `index.php`,
  `admin/config.php`, `install/index.php`, `themes/default/lumora.css`,
  `themes/classic-fansite/fansite.css`):
  A new Coppermine-inspired row-based layout for the category browser, selectable via
  Admin → Configuration → Appearance → **Category Layout**. Album and Image counts
  shown in the list view are **recursive** — they aggregate totals across all descendant
  subcategories at any depth, matching the behaviour of Coppermine's category list.
  - **`get_category_subtree_counts(array $cat_ids): array`** in `include/functions.php`:
    Accepts a list of root category IDs. Loads the full category tree once (id +
    parent_id only), resolves each root's subtree in PHP via BFS, then runs two batch
    queries (album counts, image counts) with a single `IN (...)` clause covering all
    descendant IDs. Total: three queries regardless of tree depth or category count.
    Returns `array<int, array{album_count: int, image_count: int}>` keyed by each input
    category ID.
  - **`category_layout` config key** (`'grid'` default | `'list'`): stored in
    `{PREFIX}config`; seeded as `'grid'` by the installer so fresh installs use the
    existing card grid and existing installs are completely unaffected until an admin
    opts in.
  - **`lumora_render_catlist(array $items): string`** in `include/template.php`:
    Renders each category as one row with four columns: thumbnail, category name +
    description, album count, image count. Header row labels the columns. Uses
    `lumora_render_item_thumb()` so existing cover-image configuration is honoured.
    Empty-state message matches the pattern of other render functions.
  - **`lumora_render_categories(array $items): string`** in `include/template.php`:
    Dispatcher that reads `category_layout` from config and calls either
    `lumora_render_catlist()` (list) or `lumora_render_catgrid($items, 'category')`
    (grid). All public category rendering in `index.php` now goes through this
    function; album rendering continues to call `lumora_render_catgrid()` directly.
  - **`get_categories()` extended** in `include/functions.php`: a fourth subquery
    (`image_count`) is now returned alongside the existing `album_count` and
    `subcategory_count`. Counts approved images in albums that belong directly to
    the category (not recursive). Docblock updated with `@return` array shape.
  - **Admin form field** (`admin/config.php`): a `<select>` under Admin →
    Configuration → Appearance lets the admin switch layouts. `category_layout`
    added to the POST save whitelist, `match` sanitisation branch, `$cfg` array,
    import `$safe_keys`, and pre-computed `$sel_cat_grid` / `$sel_cat_list` select
    states.
  - **CSS** (`themes/default/lumora.css`, `themes/classic-fansite/fansite.css`):
    Complete `.lum-catlist`, `.lum-catlist-header`, `.lum-catlist-row`,
    `.lum-catlist-col-thumb`, `.lum-catlist-col-name`, `.lum-catlist-col-albums`,
    `.lum-catlist-col-images`, `.lum-catlist-desc` rule sets added to both theme
    stylesheets. The default theme uses its existing `--lum-accent` and neutral
    palette; the classic-fansite theme uses `--fs-accent`, `--fs-panel-bg`,
    `--fs-panel-border`, and `--fs-radius` for full visual consistency. Both
    include a responsive `@media (max-width: 575px)` breakpoint that shrinks the
    thumbnail column (140 → 80 px / 120 × 150 → 72 × 90 px) and compacts the
    count columns.

- **Classic Fansite starter theme** (`themes/classic-fansite/`):
  A traditional fansite-style theme inspired by the gallery sites of the 2000s–2010s
  fandom era. Fully responsive; preserves the classic fixed-width centred-panel
  aesthetic on desktop.
  - `template.html` — page structure: full-bleed banner, sticky nav bar, content
    area, footer. Does not use the `{NAVIGATION}` token; instead builds its own
    nav directly with `{BASE_URL}` links for a completely custom HTML structure.
    `{CUSTOM_HEADER}` is placed inside `.fs-banner-bg` (absolute-positioned) so a
    bare `<img>` tag in the custom header file automatically becomes a full-bleed
    banner image behind the gallery title overlay.
  - `fansite.css` — all styles defined via CSS custom properties in `:root` for
    easy one-file customisation. Covers all `lum-*` component classes produced by
    `include/template.php` (thumbgrid, catgrid, stats, sort bar, pagination,
    breadcrumb, who-is-online), Bootstrap colour overrides for `.page-link`,
    `.page-item.active`, and `.btn-outline-primary`, and full responsive rules
    (mobile-first, breakpoints at 575 px and 992 px). Sticky nav scrolls
    horizontally on narrow viewports rather than wrapping.
  - `README.md` — comprehensive customisation guide: full table of CSS variables,
    five ready-to-use fandom colour presets (dark red/fantasy, ocean blue/sci-fi,
    forest green/nature, rose gold/pop, midnight gold/historical), instructions for
    adding a banner image via custom header path, and a step-by-step guide for
    creating a new derived theme.

### Changed

- **Credit footer** (`include/template.php`): Removed the version number from the
  public-facing "Powered by Lumora Gallery" footer credit. The link and credit text
  are retained; only the appended version string has been dropped.

### Added

- **Image ID column in image list** (`admin/images.php`):
  The image grid now displays each image's database ID as a dedicated **ID** column
  between the row checkbox and the thumbnail. The column uses muted styling and a fixed
  50 px width so it stays compact while remaining clearly readable. Useful for cross-
  referencing images when setting album/category cover IDs in the admin panel.

- **Album thumbnail support** (`admin/albums.php`):
  The album New/Edit form now includes a **Cover Image** field (image ID).
  Admins can specify any approved image ID as the album cover thumbnail;
  entering `0` (or leaving blank) reverts to auto-picking the first image in
  the album. The ID is validated against `{PREFIX}images` on save; invalid or
  unapproved IDs are cleared with a warning flash. The `thumb_image_id` column
  was already present in the schema and already consumed by
  `lumora_render_item_thumb()` in `include/template.php`, so no DB migration
  is required and the front-end display works immediately.

- **Image Management** (`admin/images.php`, `admin/ajax_image_delete.php`,
  `admin/ajax_image_move.php`, `admin/ajax_image_rethumb.php`):
  New dedicated admin page for managing images within an album.
  - **`admin/images.php`** — paginated image grid (24/page) with per-image
    actions and bulk operations. Album selector dropdown. Edit form supports
    updating title, sort position, and visibility (approved flag), plus optional
    file replacement via multipart upload (validates type, size, and image
    integrity; regenerates thumbnail and updates dimensions/filesize in DB).
    Single-image delete removes original + thumbnail files and DB record, and
    resets any album/category cover references (`thumb_image_id` → 0 auto-pick).
  - **`admin/ajax_image_delete.php`** — AJAX bulk delete (up to 500 images per
    call). Cleans up files on disk and resets album/category cover references.
  - **`admin/ajax_image_move.php`** — AJAX bulk move to another album (up to
    500 images per call). Moves original and thumbnail files (rename with
    copy+unlink cross-filesystem fallback); refuses to overwrite existing
    filenames in the target folder; resets source album cover reference when
    the moved image was the cover.
  - **`admin/ajax_image_rethumb.php`** — AJAX single-image thumbnail
    regeneration using current `thumb_width`/`thumb_height`/`thumb_quality`
    config values.
  - **`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`** — 📸 **Images** nav item added
    between Albums and Configuration.
  - **`admin/albums.php`** — 📸 **Manage Images** button added to each album
    row in the Albums list, linking to `images.php?album=ID`.

- **Front Page — Who Is Online** (`index.php`, `include/functions.php`,
  `include/template.php`, `install/schema.sql`):
  Active visitor tracking inspired by Coppermine's online-stats module.
  - `{PREFIX}online` table (DB version 5) — one row per distinct IP address;
    `last_action` column is updated on every public page load; stale rows are
    purged automatically after `who_is_online_duration` minutes.
  - `lumora_track_visitor()` in `include/functions.php` — records/refreshes
    the current visitor's IP. Called from `index.php` and `album.php` on every
    request. Wraps all DB work in `catch(\Throwable)` so pre-v5 installs without
    the table are completely unaffected.
  - `get_online_stats()` in `include/functions.php` — returns current online
    count and the all-time record (`online_record_count` / `online_record_date`
    config keys). Automatically updates the record when the current count exceeds
    it. Degrades gracefully to `['online' => 0, …]` when the table is absent.
  - `lumora_render_who_is_online()` in `include/template.php` — renders a
    compact strip at the bottom of the home page: visitor count, configurable
    window, and the all-time record with date.
  - `who_is_online_duration` config key (default `5`, range 1–60 minutes) —
    added to Admin → Configuration (Gallery Behavior section), save whitelist,
    `match` sanitisation branch, and the config import `$safe_keys` list.
    Also added to the installer's `$config_defaults` so fresh installs receive
    the key automatically.

- **Front Page — Statistics boxes moved to bottom** (`index.php`):
  The four stat boxes (Categories, Albums, Images, Total Views) now render
  below Latest Additions rather than above content sections. A `<hr>` separator
  visually divides the stats from the thumbnail grid.

- **Front Page — Recently Updated Albums above Categories** (`index.php`,
  `include/functions.php`):
  The home page now shows a "Recently Updated" card grid as the first section,
  above the root category grid. Albums are ordered by the newest approved image's
  `added_at` timestamp; albums with no approved images are excluded.
  `get_latest_updated_albums(int $limit)` in `include/functions.php` handles
  the query. The section is hidden when `latest_albums_count = 0`.

- **Category thumbnail support** (`include/template.php`, `admin/categories.php`,
  `install/schema.sql`): Categories now display cover thumbnails on the public gallery,
  matching the existing behaviour for albums.
  - `{PREFIX}categories` gains a `thumb_image_id` column (DB version 4). When set to a
    non-zero image ID the specified image is used as the category cover. When 0 (default)
    the system auto-picks the first approved image from any public album in that category,
    so categories that contain images get a meaningful cover without any admin action.
  - `lumora_render_item_thumb()` in `include/template.php` gains an `elseif` branch for
    `$type === 'category'`: checks `thumb_image_id` first, then falls back to the
    auto-pick SQL query. Pre-migration installs (column absent) degrade gracefully —
    `!empty($item['thumb_image_id'])` evaluates to false when the key is missing, so
    the auto-pick branch still runs and categories show a thumbnail wherever one is
    available. The old TODO comment `"a placeholder is fine for V1"` is removed.
  - `admin/categories.php` edit form gains a **Cover Image** number field (Image ID,
    0 = auto). Submitted values are validated against the `{PREFIX}images` table
    (approved = 1); an invalid ID is rejected with a warning and silently reset to 0.
    `thumb_image_id` is included in both the `INSERT` and `UPDATE` DB calls.

- **Authentication — "Stay logged in" / "Remember me" feature**:
  Admins can now opt into a 30-day persistent session by ticking the **Stay logged
  in for 30 days** checkbox on the login form. The feature uses a secure split-token
  scheme (Charles Miller / Barry Jaspan pattern):
  - A `selector` (32-char hex) is stored plain in the DB and sent in the cookie for
    fast lookup.
  - A `validator` (64-char hex) travels in the cookie only; the DB stores
    `SHA-256(validator)` so a DB compromise alone cannot forge a login.
  - Tokens are rotated on every successful auto-login to limit the exposure window.
  - If the selector matches but the validator does not, all tokens for the affected
    user are revoked immediately (theft-detection response).
  - Explicit logout (Admin → Log Out) clears all persistent tokens for the user and
    expires the cookie. Session-expiry during active browsing does **not** clear the
    cookie; `bootstrap.php` transparently re-establishes the session on the next
    request.
  - New constants in `include/auth.php`: `LUMORA_REMEMBER_COOKIE` (`lumora_remember`)
    and `LUMORA_REMEMBER_DAYS` (`30`).
  - New functions: `lumora_create_remember_token()`, `lumora_check_remember_cookie()`,
    `lumora_clear_remember_cookie()`, `lumora_clear_remember_tokens()`.
  - `lumora_login()` gains an optional `bool $remember = false` parameter.
  - `lumora_logout()` gains an optional `bool $clear_remember = false` parameter;
    all existing call sites without the argument are unaffected.
  - `include/bootstrap.php` — step 11a added: calls `lumora_check_remember_cookie()`
    after session start when no active session is found.
  - `admin/login.php` — "Stay logged in for 30 days" checkbox added below the
    password field.
  - `admin/logout.php` — passes `true` to `lumora_logout()` so tokens are revoked
    on explicit logout.
  - All DB operations on `{PREFIX}remember_tokens` are wrapped in
    `catch(\Throwable)` so installations that have not yet run the migration are
    fully unaffected (cookie silently not set; no auto-login attempted).

### Changed

- **Renamed "Maintenance" to "Tools"** in all admin UI surfaces
  (`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`, `admin/maintenance.php`):
  - Sidebar nav label updated from `Maintenance` to `Tools`.
  - Page `<h1>` and `<title>` updated from `Maintenance` to `Tools`.
  - File docblock updated to reflect the new name.
  The underlying filename (`maintenance.php`) has since been renamed to `tools.php`
  and the nav key updated from `maintenance` to `tools` (see below).

- **Renamed `maintenance.php` to `tools.php`** (`admin/maintenance.php` → `admin/tools.php`,
  `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`):
  - File physically renamed on disk.
  - Nav array key updated from `'maintenance'` to `'tools'`.
  - Nav `url` updated from `'maintenance.php'` to `'tools.php'`.
  - `$maint_url_h` variable updated to point to `admin/tools.php`.
  - `lum_admin_page()` active-key argument updated from `'maintenance'` to `'tools'`.
  - `README.md` directory listing and Features section updated accordingly.

- **Powered By credit moved from themes to core template system**
  (`themes/default/template.html`, `include/template.php`, `admin/config.php`,
  `install/index.php`):
  The Powered By credit is now rendered by the core and injected via the
  `{POWERED_BY}` template token, so future themes receive it automatically
  without duplicating any markup.
  - `themes/default/template.html` — hardcoded `<small>Powered by …</small>`
    footer markup replaced with the `{POWERED_BY}` token. The footer element
    itself remains in the theme so designers retain full control over placement.
  - `lumora_render_powered_by()` added to `include/template.php` — returns the
    credit HTML (or an empty string when disabled); reads
    `lumora_config('show_powered_by', '1')`. The token is populated in
    `lumora_render_page()` alongside all other standard tokens.
  - `show_powered_by` config key (default `1`) added to Admin → Configuration
    under the **Appearance** section as a toggle switch labelled **Show Powered
    By Credit**. Included in the save whitelist, `$bool_keys`, `$cfg` read,
    and config import `$safe_keys`.
  - `show_powered_by` seeded as `'1'` in the installer's `$config_defaults` for
    new installations.

- **Album delete — empty folder removal** (`admin/albums.php`): Deleting an album now
  attempts to remove its physical directory when it is empty.
  - The folder path is fetched before the DB rows are deleted.
  - After the DB deletion, `scandir()` is used to check whether the directory
    contains only `.` and `..`. If empty, `rmdir()` is called.
  - The flash message reflects the outcome: folder removed, folder non-empty and kept,
    folder not found on disk, or removal failed (with a prompt to use FTP).
  - The delete-confirm dialog wording is updated to describe the new behaviour.
  - Non-empty folders (containing images) are never touched.

### Security

- **Path traversal protection for custom header/footer files** (`include/template.php`):
  `lumora_custom_header()` and `lumora_custom_footer()` now use `realpath()` to verify
  that the configured file path resolves strictly within `LUMORA_ROOT` before reading.
  A path like `../../etc/passwd` in the config is rejected outright. Extracted into a
  new shared helper `lumora_load_custom_file()`.

- **Safer AJAX base URL in maintenance page** (`admin/maintenance.php`):
  The JavaScript `AJAX_BASE` constant now uses `lumora_base_url()` (from DB config)
  instead of reconstructing the URL from `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`, eliminating a
  theoretical HTTP Host header injection vector on certain reverse-proxy setups.

### Fixed

- **`admin/maintenance.php` — Bug #6 (continued): `SyntaxError` killed entire script**:
  A PHP heredoc interprets `\n` as a real newline byte (identical to double-quoted
  strings). The `confirm()` dialog string contained `'...database?\n\n'`, which caused
  PHP to emit two literal newline characters inside the JS single-quoted string literal,
  producing an `Uncaught SyntaxError: '' string literal contains an unescaped line break`
  at column 94 on the rendered page. Because a `SyntaxError` aborts the entire script
  block before any code runs, all three maintenance tools appeared completely dead (no
  network requests, no DOM changes on button click). Fixed by escaping the newlines as
  `\\n\\n` in the heredoc, which PHP outputs as `\n\n` — the correct JS escape
  sequences.

- **Removed all `@` error-suppression operators** in compliance with PHP development
  standards (`CLAUDE.md` §Error Handling — "Never suppress errors with `@` operators"):
  - `admin/ajax_batch.php`, `admin/ajax_dimensions.php`, `admin/ajax_integrity.php`,
    `admin/ajax_thumbs.php`: `@set_time_limit()` → `set_time_limit()`.
  - `admin/albums.php`: `@mkdir()` → `mkdir()`.
  - `install/index.php`: two `@mkdir()` → `mkdir()` (requirements check and
    albums-directory creation).
  - `include/thumb.php`: `@getimagesize()`, `@imagecreatefromjpeg/png/gif/webp()`,
    `@unlink()`, `@rename()`, `@filesize()` operators removed. `is_file()` pre-checks
    added to `lumora_get_image_dimensions()` and `lumora_get_filesize()` so the common
    "file not found" case is handled without emitting a warning. Warnings for corrupt
    or unreadable image files are now correctly forwarded to the PHP error log rather
    than silently swallowed.

- **HTML/JS injection in delete-confirm dialogs** (`admin/categories.php`,
  `admin/albums.php`): Replaced `addslashes()` + inline `onsubmit="return confirm('...')"` 
  with a `data-confirm` HTML attribute populated via `h()` and read by
  `this.dataset.confirm` in the event handler. A category or album name containing
  `"`, `>`, or a newline could previously break out of the HTML attribute or terminate
  the JS string literal.

### Database migrations (DB v2 → v5)

All three migrations must be applied **in order** on existing installations.
Replace `lum_` with your actual table prefix throughout. Fresh installations from
`install/schema.sql` receive all tables and columns automatically.

**DB v2 → v3** — persistent login tokens:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `lum_remember_tokens` (
  `id`               bigint UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `user_id`          int UNSIGNED    NOT NULL,
  `selector`         varchar(32)     NOT NULL,
  `hashed_validator` varchar(64)     NOT NULL,
  `expires_at`       datetime        NOT NULL,
  `created_at`       datetime        NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `selector`  (`selector`),
  KEY `user_id`          (`user_id`),
  KEY `expires_at`       (`expires_at`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

**DB v3 → v4** — category cover thumbnails:

```sql
ALTER TABLE `lum_categories`
  ADD COLUMN `thumb_image_id` int UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
    COMMENT 'FK to images.id; 0 = auto-pick first album image';
```

**DB v4 → v5** — who-is-online tracking:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `lum_online` (
  `ip`          varchar(45)  NOT NULL,
  `last_action` datetime     NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
                             ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ip`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Installs that skip any migration degrade gracefully — all related calls fail silently
without other errors.

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`install/index.php` — auto-delete installer on success**: after writing `config.php`
  and creating the `albums/` directory, the installer now calls `ins_delete_installer()`
  which removes all files inside `install/` then removes the directory itself. On
  Unix/Linux this succeeds even while `index.php` is the running script (the process
  holds the fd in memory). The completion page shows a green success notice if
  deletion worked.

- **`install/index.php` — installer delete failure warning**: if `ins_delete_installer()`
  returns `false` (restrictive filesystem permissions, Windows), the completion page
  shows an amber warning asking the admin to remove the directory manually.

- **`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php` — persistent `install/` security warning**:
  every admin panel page now checks at render time whether `install/` exists on disk.
  If it does, a red dismissible alert is shown above the flash messages on every page
  until the directory is gone. Covers both the auto-delete failure case and existing
  installations where the installer directory was never cleaned up.

- **`latest_albums_count` config key** (default `5`) — controls how many recently
  updated albums are displayed on the home page. Set to `0` to hide the section
  entirely. Accepted range: 0–50.
  - Added to the installer's `$config_defaults` so all fresh installs receive the key.
  - Admin UI control added to **Admin → Configuration → Gallery Behavior** under the
    existing Count Album Views / Gallery Offline row.
  - Included in the save whitelist, `match` sanitisation branch
    (`max(0, min(50, ...))`) and the config import `$safe_keys` list.

- **`get_latest_updated_albums(int $limit): array`** in `include/functions.php` —
  returns public albums ordered by their newest approved image's `added_at` timestamp.
  Excludes albums with no approved images. Used by the home page "Recently Updated
  Albums" section.

### Changed

- **`admin/includes/admin_helpers.php` — admin panel branding**: navbar brand updated
  from `⚡ Lumora Admin` to `⚡ Lumora Gallery Admin` with the version string
  (`v{ver}`) appended inline as a small, muted `<span>`. Sidebar version badge
  removed (version is now shown in the topbar only). Page `<title>` updated from
  `— Lumora Admin` to `— Lumora Gallery Admin` throughout.

- **`admin/login.php`**: login card `<h1>` updated from `⚡ Lumora Admin` to
  `⚡ Lumora Gallery Admin` to match.

- **`admin/dashboard.php`**, **`admin/account.php`**, **`admin/config.php`**: added
  missing `@copyright`/`@license` GPL v3 headers to bring all three files in line
  with the rest of the codebase (every other file already had them).

- **`TODO.md`**: marked all four Maintenance items complete (`[x]`): Reload
  Dimensions, Update Thumbnails, File Integrity Check, and Album Scope Selector were
  all fully implemented in a previous session but not ticked off. Legal items (GPL v3
  licence, developer credits) and the "Make the number of last updated Albums
  selectable in config" item also marked complete.

### Fixed

- **`admin/maintenance.php` — Bug #6: maintenance actions non-functional**:
  Three compounding issues prevented all three maintenance tools (Integrity Scan,
  Reload Dimensions, Regenerate Thumbnails) from working:
  1. **Null guard missing on `$cancel`**: each IIFE guarded `$start` but called
     `$cancel.addEventListener()` unconditionally. A null `$cancel` would throw a
     `TypeError` that silently aborted the entire `DOMContentLoaded` callback, leaving
     all three tools without click listeners. Fixed by adding `!$cancel` to each guard.
  2. **Relative AJAX URLs**: `fetch('ajax_integrity.php', …)` etc. resolved against
     `window.location`, which breaks on sub-path installs or under URL rewriting.
     Fixed by injecting an absolute `AJAX_BASE` constant. The constant was already
     declared but never used — all four `fetch()` calls now use it.
  3. **AJAX_BASE derived from `base_url` config**: if `base_url` is empty or wrong,
     `AJAX_BASE` would also be wrong. Fixed by constructing the URL directly from
     `$_SERVER['HTTPS']`, `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`, and `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` —
     always accurate regardless of config state.
  4. **Silent error masking**: when `fetchChunk()` fails (403, 404, 500, or network
     error) it correctly shows "Error: …" in the status element, but the surrounding
     `startScan()`/`startTool()` loop then calls `finishScan()`/`finishTool()` which
     immediately overwrites the status with "Scan complete." and snaps the progress bar
     to 100% — making every AJAX failure look like an instant silent success. Fixed by
     adding a `fetchFailed` flag: when set, `finishScan()`/`finishTool()` is skipped
     so the error message remains visible.

- **`admin/categories.php` — Bug #1** `cat_parent_options()`: malformed `<option>` HTML
  (`<option value="0"— Root...` was missing the closing `>` after the attribute value),
  causing the "Root (no parent)" option to render as broken markup in every category
  parent dropdown.

- **`admin/categories.php` — Bug #7** Dead heredoc referencing `$s_total` before it was
  defined generated a PHP `E_WARNING: Undefined variable` on every page load.
  Removed the dead heredoc and redundant `str_replace()` call; the list is now built
  directly via string concatenation with `$s_total` correctly in scope.

- **`admin/config.php` — Config export always returned HTTP 403**: the export URL
  placed the CSRF token in `$_GET`, but the code called `lumora_csrf_validate()` which
  checks `$_POST['csrf_token']` only. Replaced with an inline `$_GET['csrf_token']`
  check so the export link works as intended.

- **`include/bootstrap.php` — DB error leaked connection details**: the `RuntimeException`
  message from a failed PDO connection (which may include host, dbname, or username)
  was passed directly to `htmlspecialchars()` and output to the browser. Now logs the
  full message via `error_log()` and shows only a generic message to visitors.

- **`include/bootstrap.php` — `@` error suppression on timezone set**: replaced
  `@date_default_timezone_set()` (which violates the "Never suppress errors with @"
  standard) with an explicit `in_array(..., \DateTimeZone::listIdentifiers())` check
  before calling `date_default_timezone_set()`. Invalid identifiers fall back to UTC
  with no suppressor needed.

- **`admin/albums.php` — SQL concatenation in list query**: the optional category
  filter was applied by appending `' WHERE a.category_id = ' . $filter_cat` to the
  SQL string, violating "use prepared statements exclusively". Replaced with two
  dedicated queries, each using `?` parameter binding.

- **`admin/batch.php` — CSRF token injected into JS with HTML-escaping**: used
  `'{$csrf}'` (HTML-escaped) instead of `{$csrf_js}` (json-encoded). While safe in
  practice for hex tokens, the pattern was inconsistent with `maintenance.php`'s
  correct `json_encode()` approach. Fixed to use `$csrf_js = json_encode(...)` and
  `var csrf = {$csrf_js};`.

### Identified (deferred — no code change)

The following issues were found during the audit but deferred because they require
an architectural or policy decision rather than a straightforward fix:

- **`@` suppression on filesystem operations** (`@getimagesize`, `@imagecreatefromjpeg`,
  `@rename`, `@unlink`, `@mkdir`) across `include/thumb.php`, `include/functions.php`,
  `admin/albums.php`, and `install/index.php`. These suppress E_WARNING from the PHP
  runtime. Eliminating them requires a consistent policy (e.g. a filesystem wrapper
  that converts warnings to exceptions) and is a larger refactor.
- **Global `$LUMORA_CONFIG`** in `include/functions.php` — violates "avoid global
  state"; migrating to a static class property or registry is an architectural change.
- **Duplicated `<optgroup>` album-selector loop** in `admin/batch.php` and
  `admin/maintenance.php` — should be extracted to `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php`.

### Audited (no change needed — already compliant)

The following TODO items and suspected issues were confirmed **already fixed** in the
current codebase (all verified by reading each file in full):

- Bug #2: `$new_count` initialised to `0` before conditional in `batch.php`.
- Bug #3: Installer Step 1 POST handler is reachable and functions correctly.
- Bug #4: All `config.php` output values are pre-escaped with `h()` into `$v_*`
  variables before heredoc interpolation; no `str_replace()` escaping attempt exists.
- Bug #5: `declare(strict_types=1)` present in all 26 PHP source files.
- Bug #6: All three maintenance tools (integrity scan, reload dimensions,
  regenerate thumbnails) are fully implemented with proper `fetch()` AJAX handlers.
- Bug #8: Installer uses `date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $ts)` for human-readable timestamps.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **8 new configuration options** — all accessible in Admin → Configuration under the
  new **Gallery Behavior** and **Upload & Image Limits** sections:
  - `timezone` (default `UTC`) — PHP timezone string (e.g. `Europe/Helsinki`) applied
    at bootstrap via `date_default_timezone_set()`; validated against
    `DateTimeZone::listIdentifiers()`.
  - `thumb_quality` (default `85`) — JPEG/WebP thumbnail quality 1–100; replaces the
    hardcoded value in both the Imagick and GD thumbnail engines.
  - `max_upload_size_mb` (default `0` = unlimited) — maximum file size accepted during
    Batch Add; files exceeding the limit are skipped with an `error_log()` entry.
  - `max_image_width` / `max_image_height` (default `0` = no limit) — resize originals
    before storing if they exceed the configured dimensions; applied atomically via a
    temp file + rename. Quality is hardcoded at 92 for originals, independent of
    `thumb_quality`.
  - `count_album_views` (default `1`) — toggle the album hit counter; `0` disables
    counting without removing existing counts.
  - `log_mode` (`off` / `errors` / `all`) — controls `lumora_log()`: `off` = no-op;
    `errors` = PHP `error_log()` for error-type events only; `all` = PHP error log +
    DB insert into `{PREFIX}log` (requires DB version 2 — see migration below).
  - `gallery_offline` (default `0`) — maintenance mode; non-admin visitors receive
    HTTP 503 + `Retry-After: 3600`; admins always see the real gallery.

- **`{PREFIX}log` table** — new table added in DB version 2, used when
  `log_mode = all`. Columns: `id`, `type` (varchar 16), `message` (text), `ip`
  (varchar 45), `created_at` (datetime). Keyed on `(type, created_at)`.
  See *Database migration* below for the SQL.

- **`lumora_log(string $type, string $message)`** in `include/functions.php` —
  central logging helper; behaviour controlled entirely by `log_mode`. Writes to
  `{PREFIX}log` are wrapped in `catch(\Throwable)` so pre-v2 installs without the
  table are unaffected at any `log_mode` setting.

- **`lumora_resize_original(string $path, int $max_w, int $max_h): bool`** in
  `include/thumb.php` — resizes an original image in-place when it exceeds the
  configured dimension limits. Uses a temp file + atomic rename to avoid partial
  writes; falls back to copy+unlink on cross-filesystem moves.

- **LICENSE** — project is now released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
  `LICENSE` file added to repository root.

- **Developer credit** — `README.md` Development section lists developer Ariane with
  repository link (<https://coding.unloved-heart.net/lumora/>).

- **Image view counter** — view counts are now actually recorded when visitors use
  the lightbox. Previously `increment_image_hits()` existed in the codebase but was
  never called, so the `hits` column stayed at 0 for every image.
  - `ajax_hit.php` (new file) — lightweight public AJAX endpoint that accepts a
    `POST image_id` and increments the image's hit counter. Throttled to one
    increment per image per PHP session so rapidly navigating through a lightbox
    or refreshing the page does not inflate counts. No CSRF token required (a
    public view counter is not a sensitive or destructive action).
  - `lumora_render_thumbgrid()` in `include/template.php` — each thumbnail anchor
    now carries a `data-image-id` attribute containing the database image ID.
  - `lumora_render_lightbox_js()` in `include/template.php` — now accepts an
    optional `string $base_url = ''` parameter used to build the absolute URL for
    `ajax_hit.php`. A tiny non-module `<script>` block writes
    `window.__lumHitUrl` before the ESM module runs so the module can reach the
    endpoint without PHP variable interpolation inside the nowdoc. A `change`
    listener on the PhotoSwipe instance fires a fire-and-forget `XMLHttpRequest`
    POST every time a new image is displayed (including the first image when the
    lightbox opens). The response is intentionally ignored.
  - `index.php` and `album.php` — both calls to `lumora_render_lightbox_js()` now
    pass `lumora_base_url()` so the hit endpoint resolves correctly regardless of
    subdirectory installation depth.

- `admin/maintenance.php` — new **Maintenance** admin page with a **File Integrity
  Check** tool. Scans every image record in the database and verifies that both the
  original file and its thumbnail exist on disk. Runs in AJAX chunks of 500 so it
  handles galleries with 500 000+ images without hitting PHP's time limit. Includes
  a live progress bar, a cancel button, and a results table showing each missing
  original / thumbnail with a per-row checkbox. A "Select all / Delete Selected
  Records" control lets the admin bulk-remove orphaned DB entries in one click.
  **Only database records are removed — no files on disk are ever touched.**

- `admin/ajax_integrity.php` — AJAX endpoint for the integrity scan. Uses
  **keyset pagination** (`WHERE id > last_id`) so query time stays constant
  regardless of gallery size; plain `OFFSET` would become progressively slower
  beyond ~100 000 rows. Returns `checked`, `last_id`, `missing[]`, and `done` per
  chunk. `LEFT JOIN` on albums catches image records whose album row has been
  deleted (reported as `[Album deleted]` with both files flagged missing).

- `admin/ajax_integrity_delete.php` — AJAX endpoint that deletes a set of image
  records by ID. Accepts `ids[]` (max 5 000 per call), validates CSRF, casts all
  values to positive integers, runs deletes inside a single transaction, and returns
  `deleted` count plus any per-row `errors[]`. No files on disk are touched.

- `admin/account.php` — Account Management page. Allows the logged-in admin to update
  their username and email address (with uniqueness check), and change their password
  (requires current-password verification, minimum 8 characters, confirm field with
  live client-side match indicator). Session username is kept in sync after a
  successful profile update.

- `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php` — **Account** entry (👤) added to the sidebar
  navigation after Configuration. The username displayed in the top bar is now a
  clickable link to `account.php`.

- `lumora_sanitize_folder()` in `include/functions.php`: centralised album folder-path
  sanitisation. Allows letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and dots per segment;
  forward slashes for subdirectory nesting (e.g. `Xena/Season1/1x01-SinsOfThePast`).
  Strips path traversal (`..`), hidden-directory segments (leading dot), and any
  characters outside the allowed set.

### Fixed

- **Batch Add — Process button did nothing** (`admin/batch.php`, `admin/ajax_batch.php`).
  Two bugs combined to make the button completely unresponsive:
  1. `$new_count` was never initialised before the `if ($selected)` block. When the
     page loads without an album selected PHP 8 emits `E_WARNING: Undefined variable
     $new_count` during heredoc interpolation, producing `const total = ;` in the
     rendered JavaScript — a **SyntaxError** that prevents the entire IIFE from
     running. Because `addEventListener` was never called, clicking the button had no
     effect on any subsequent page load in the same browser session.
  2. `ajax_batch.php` re-ran `lumora_scan_new_images()` on every AJAX call, returning
     a shorter list each time (processed images are now in the DB). The JS kept
     incrementing an offset against the original full count, so by the second chunk
     the offset already landed in the wrong position; by ~chunk 7 it exceeded
     `count($all_new)` entirely — `array_slice` returned `[]`, the server replied
     `done=true` with 0 processed, and the rest of the album was silently skipped.

  **Fixes applied:**
  - `$new_count = 0` initialised before `if ($selected)` so the heredoc always has
    a valid integer, eliminating the JS SyntaxError.
  - Switched from `async/await` + `fetch` to a plain `XMLHttpRequest` loop, removing
    one layer of implicit Promise rejection that could swallow errors silently.
    Also added a 3-minute `xhr.timeout` and explicit `onerror`/`ontimeout` handlers.
  - `ajax_batch.php`: removed the `$offset` parameter entirely. The handler now always
    calls `array_slice($all_new, 0, $limit)` — "process the first N still-unprocessed
    files". Because `lumora_scan_new_images()` filters out DB entries, each subsequent
    call naturally advances to the next unprocessed batch without any offset
    arithmetic.
  - Added an infinite-loop guard in `ajax_batch.php`: if a chunk is non-empty but
    every file in it fails (processed=0, errors=all), `done` is forced to `true` so
    the client stops retrying the same broken files forever.
  - `done` condition corrected to `count($all_new) <= $limit` (was
    `($offset + $limit) >= count($all_new)`, which was wrong once offset was removed).

- `lumora_album_url()` in `include/functions.php`: was calling `rawurlencode()` on the
  entire folder string, encoding `/` separators to `%2F` and breaking nested paths.
  Now encodes each path segment individually while preserving slashes.

- Album folder sanitisation in `admin/albums.php` now uses `lumora_sanitize_folder()`
  (the previous inline `preg_replace` also stripped dots, breaking names like
  `1.01-EpisodeTitle` or `Season.1`).

- `install/index.php` — blank page on first visit: PHP's `{$...}` heredoc
  interpolation does not support expressions like ternary operators; pre-computed
  step indicator classes into plain variables instead.

- `install/index.php` — schema created no tables: `preg_split('/;\s*\n/', ...)` split
  the SQL into segments that each began with `-- comment` header lines; the
  `str_starts_with($s, '--')` filter then silently discarded every segment containing
  a `CREATE TABLE` statement. Fixed by stripping comment/blank lines from the SQL
  *before* splitting on semicolons, extracted into `ins_run_schema()`.

- `install/index.php` — blank page on "Finish Installation": the config-defaults loop
  and user INSERT/UPDATE had no error handling; an uncaught `PDOException` (caused by
  the missing tables above) produced a blank page. All DB writes in step 2 are now
  wrapped in `try/catch` blocks that render a clear error page with a "Start Over"
  link instead.

- `install/index.php` — replaced the `INSERT … exec(quote())` pattern for config and
  user writes with proper PDO prepared statements (`prepare` / `execute`), and
  replaced the two-query INSERT+UPDATE fallback for users with a single
  `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`.

### Changed

- `include/bootstrap.php` — step 13 added: reads `timezone` config and calls
  `date_default_timezone_set()`; falls back to UTC silently on invalid identifier.

- `include/template.php` → `lumora_render_page()` — gallery offline check: returns
  HTTP 503 with `Retry-After: 3600` and a maintenance message to non-admins;
  admins always see real content.

- `include/thumb.php` → `lumora_generate_thumb()` — `int $quality = 0` parameter
  added; `0` reads from `thumb_quality` config. Both Imagick and GD engines accept
  and apply the quality value.

- `include/thumb.php` → `lumora_batch_add_image()` — now applies (1) size limit
  check, (2) optional original resize, then (3) thumbnail generation in that order.

- `album.php` — album hit counter now gated by `count_album_views` config; album
  visits logged via `lumora_log()`.

- `ajax_hit.php` — if `gallery_offline = 1`, returns `{"ok":true}` without
  incrementing (prevents JS console errors for offline visitors).

- `install/index.php` — `$config_defaults` now seeds all 8 new config keys on fresh
  installs.

- `admin/config.php` — new **Gallery Behavior** section (Timezone, Logging Mode,
  Count Album Views, Gallery Offline Mode) and **Upload & Image Limits** section
  (Thumbnail Quality, Max File Size, Max Original Width/Height) added to the
  settings form.

- `admin/includes/admin_helpers.php` — **Maintenance** (🔧) entry added to the
  sidebar navigation between Configuration and Account.

- Album **Folder Path** field in Admin → Albums now explicitly supports nested paths
  (`ShowName/Season2/EpisodeSlug`). Updated placeholder, hint text, and removed the
  `pattern` attribute that only allowed a flat name.

- `README.md` — Image & Thumbnail Storage section rewritten to show the nested
  directory layout with a real-world example; Coppermine Migration section updated
  with step-by-step folder path instructions; Configuration table expanded with all
  8 new config keys.

- `install/index.php` — `config.php` is now generated via string concatenation
  instead of a heredoc, eliminating delimiter-collision risk. Generated file now
  includes `declare(strict_types=1);`.

- `include/thumb.php` — image processor changed from CLI `exec('convert ...')` to the
  **Imagick PHP extension** (`ext-imagick`) as the primary engine. New
  `lumora_thumb_imagick()` uses `autoOrient()` for EXIF correction,
  `thumbnailImage($w, $h, true)` for aspect-ratio-preserving resize, and
  `stripImage()` for metadata removal. Upscaling is explicitly prevented by checking
  dimensions before resizing. **GD** remains the fallback when `ext-imagick` is not
  loaded. The old CLI-based `lumora_thumb_imagemagick()` function has been removed.

- `admin/config.php` — removed the **ImageMagick Binary Directory** config field
  (`im_path`). Replaced with a read-only **Image Processor** status line that shows
  which engine is active at runtime (`✓ Imagick PHP extension` / `⚠ GD library` /
  `✗ None found`). `im_path` removed from the save whitelist and import safe-key list.

- `install/index.php` — requirements check updated: the **GD or ImageMagick** row now
  checks `extension_loaded('imagick')` and `extension_loaded('gd')` instead of
  probing CLI binary paths. `im_path` removed from the config defaults seeded on
  installation.

- `README.md` — Requirements table updated (`Imagick (preferred) or GD`); Thumbnail
  generation section rewritten to describe the extension-based approach; `im_path`
  removed from the Configuration table.

### Database migration (DB v1 → v2)

Run the following SQL once on existing installations (replace `lum_` with your actual
table prefix if different):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `lum_log` (
  `id`         bigint UNSIGNED  NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `type`       varchar(16)      NOT NULL,
  `message`    text             NOT NULL,
  `ip`         varchar(45)      NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `created_at` datetime         NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `type_created` (`type`, `created_at`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

The table is only written to when `log_mode = all`. If the table is absent,
`lumora_log()` catches the exception silently — no breakage occurs at any
`log_mode` setting on pre-v2 installs.

Fresh installations from `install/schema.sql` receive the table automatically.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-06

### Changed

- Added `declare(strict_types=1);` to all 21 PHP files (`include/`, `admin/`,
  `admin/includes/`, `install/`, public entry points, `version.php`,
  `config.sample.php`).
